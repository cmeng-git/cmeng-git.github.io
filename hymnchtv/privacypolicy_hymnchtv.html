	<span id='calOppa'></span>

	<div class='blueText'>California Online Privacy Protection Act</div>
	<div class='innerText'>CalOPPA is the first state law in the
		nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a
		privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to
		require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably
		the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable
		Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy
		policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected
		and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. Read more at
		<a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf">CalOPPA</a>"
	</div>

	<div class='blueText'>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</div>
	<div class='innerText'>Users can visit our site anonymously.</div>
	<div class='innerText'>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as
	  a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.</div>
	<div class='innerText'>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page
	  specified above.</div>

		<ul>
			<li>On our Privacy Policy Page</li>
			<li>Upon update the installed app</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class='innerText'>Can change your personal information:

	<span id='coppAct'></span>

	<div class='blueText'>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</div>
	<div class='innerText'>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age
	  of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal
	  Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what
		operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.</div>

	<div class='blueText'>Do we let third-parties, including ad networks or plug-ins collect PII from children under 13?</div>
	<div class='innerText'>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</div>
	<span id='ftcFip'></span>

	<div class='blueText'>Fair Information Practices</div>
	<div class='innerText'>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the
	  United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data
	  protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should
	  be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</div>

	<div class='blueText'>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive
	  action, should a data breach occur:</div>
	<div class='innerText'>We will notify you:
		<ul>
			<li>via email within 7 business days</li>
			<li>immediately upon update of the installed app</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div class='innerText'>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have
	  the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the
	  law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that
	individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
