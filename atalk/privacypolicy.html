	<div class='innerText'>This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their
	   'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) is being used. PII, as described in US privacy law and information
	   security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate
	   a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear
		 understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your personally Identifiable Information
		 in accordance with our website or app.
	</div>

	<span id='infoCo'></span>
	<div class='grayText'>Information Collection and Use</div>
	
  <div class='innerText'>aTalk is an XMPP client that connects to your chosen XMPP server. The App does not collect, store,
    or share any personal information unless explicitly provided by the user for the purpose of XMPP communication.
    The App facilitates communication through XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) and relies on the
    user's chosen XMPP provider for data exchange.<div>

   <b><br/>XMPP Communication</b>
   <div class='innerText'>aTalk or its developers don’t have control over the data you send through the app. However
     the following data might get uploaded to your XMPP provider via user explicit actions:</div>  
   <ul>
			<li>Messages. This includes text messages, images and other files</li>
			<li>Your avatar / profile picture</li>
			<li>Your public keys for the OMEMO encryption</li>
	 </ul>	
	
   <b>What does not get uploaded</b>
   <ul>
			<li>Your contacts. aTalk only asks permissions to read your contact to show the profile pictures and names of
			  the corresponding XMPP contacts. Your contacts are never published anywhere. If you opt-out of this permission
			  aTalk will work just fine.</li>
	 </ul>	

	<div class='innerText'><b>aTalk website access:<br/></b>
  <ul>
			<li>aTalk website provides aTalk's features detailed descriptions, and online help on the use of aTalk app.</li>
 			<li>We only provide articles and information. We never ask for personal or private information like names,
			   email addresses, or credit card numbers.</li>
      <li>The site does not use cookies for tracking purposes</li>		   
      <li>The site uses SSL certificate for secure communications.</li>
 	</ul>
 	</div>

	<div class='grayText'>Data Security</div>
  <div class='innerText'>aTalk takes the security of your data seriously. The XMPP communication is encrypted, and the App
    does not store or process messages on external servers.</div>
  
	<div class='grayText'>Permissions</div>
  <div class='innerText'>The App requests specific permissions to function properly. These permissions include network
    access for XMPP communication and push notifications, as well as device storage access for media sharing if
    applicable. aTalk does not misuse these permissions and only uses them for the intended purpose of providing
    the XMPP communication service.</div>

	<div class='grayText'>Developer’s Data Retention and Deletion Policy</div>
  <div class='innerText'>aTalk does not retain personal or sensitive user data on external servers. The App adheres to
    a data retention and deletion policy that ensures user data is only stored for the duration necessary to provide
    the XMPP communication service. Users have the ability to manage their data through the settings provided within
    the App.</div>
    <div class='innerText'>Note: aTalk does not have administration right on user chosen xmpp server. All user required
      actions on the server must send their requests to the user chosen XMPP server administrator.</div>
    

	<span id='infoUs'></span>
	<div class='grayText'>How do we use your information?</div>
  <div class='innerText'>aTalk does not upload data to the developer. The only exception to this rule is data collected
     after a crash. This data may send via the app to the developer email account, but only with your explicit consent.<div>  

	<div class='innerText'>
		We may use the information we received from you via email in the following ways:
		<ul>
			<li>To allow us to better service you in responding to your customer service requests.</li>
			<li>The information is used strictly for the purpose of analysing and solving issues, that users are experiencing.</li>
			<li>We do not keep records of your name or email address, or any files containing those information.</li>
			<li>We will never use the information for marketing purpose or provide your information to third parties.</li>
		</ul>	
	</div>

	<div class='grayText'>Third-party disclosure</div>
	<div class='innerText'>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable
	  Information.</div>
	<span id='trLi'></span>

	<div class='grayText'>Third-party links</div>
	<div class='innerText'>We do not include or offer third-party products or services on our website or in app.</div>
	<span id='gooAd'></span>
	
	<div class='blueText'>Google</div>
	<div class='innerText'>Google's advertising requirements can be summed up by Google's Advertising Principles.
	  They are put in place to provide a positive experience for users. See
	  <a href="https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en">Google AdSense</a></div>
	<div class='innerText'>We do not enabled Google AdSense on our site.</div>
	<span id='calOppa'></span>

	<div class='blueText'>California Online Privacy Protection Act</div>
	<div class='innerText'>CalOPPA is the first state law in the
		nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a
		privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to
		require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably
		the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable
		Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy
		policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected
		and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. Read more at
		<a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf">CalOPPA</a>"
	</div>

	<div class='blueText'>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</div>
	<div class='innerText'>Users can visit our site anonymously.</div>
	<div class='innerText'>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as
	  a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.</div>
	<div class='innerText'>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page
	  specified above.</div>
	<div class='innerText'>You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:
		<ul>
			<li>On our Privacy Policy Page</li>
			<li>Upon update the installed app</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class='innerText'>Can change your personal information:
		<ul>
			<li>By logging in to your account</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div class='blueText'>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</div>
	<div class='innerText'>We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when
	  a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.</div>

	<div class='blueText'>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</div>
	<div class='innerText'>It's also important to note that we do not allow third-party behavioral tracking</div>
	<span id='coppAct'></span>

	<div class='blueText'>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</div>
	<div class='innerText'>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age
	  of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal
	  Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what
		operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.</div>

	<div class='blueText'>Do we let third-parties, including ad networks or plug-ins collect PII from children under 13?</div>
	<div class='innerText'>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</div>
	<span id='ftcFip'></span>

	<div class='blueText'>Fair Information Practices</div>
	<div class='innerText'>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the
	  United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data
	  protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should
	  be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</div>

	<div class='blueText'>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive
	  action, should a data breach occur:</div>
	<div class='innerText'>We will notify you:
		<ul>
			<li>via email within 7 business days</li>
			<li>immediately upon update of the installed app</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div class='innerText'>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have
	  the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the
	  law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that
	individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
