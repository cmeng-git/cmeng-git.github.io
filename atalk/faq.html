   <!-- ========================= User UI Implementation ====================== -->
   <div id='subSection'>aTalk UI design &amp; Implementation</div>

   <span id='ui_01'></span>
   <div class='blueText'>[20200619] aTalk UI design &amp; Implementation <a href=#content>{ Content }</a></div>
   <div class='innerText'>In aTalk UI design, user interaction with the application uses mainly android device touch
     screen and gestures to navigate or access to other menu. Generally aTalk uses the following gestures and click
     actions to access to other part of the menus.
     <ul>
       <li><b>ViewPager</b>: aTalk uses android ViewPager concept to present multiple menus. User slides left/right
         to access to other menus of similar category. ViewPager navigation is used in main UI, and during chat
         sessions for 1:1 chats and Group chats.
         <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/animation/screen-slide">Slide between fragments using ViewPager</a></li>
       <li><b>Pull Down Menu</b>: Each menu is usually accompanied with other user selectable options. These options are
         accessed via tool icons shown in the navigation bar, or pull down for menu overflow options. On some older
         android device, there is a dedicated Menu button.</li>
       <li><b>Chat/Info Access</b>: Some of the information or aTalk feature is accessed via a quick touch/click on the
         item or displayed icon on the view page e.g. presence status icon, call buttons and avatar etc. Click on the
         contact or chat room listed item launches the chat session.</li>
       <li><b>Context Menu</b>: All aTalk context menus are accessed via long click/press on the item. Long press on
         contact item in the main menu will pop up the context menu e.g. to activate Text->Speech for incoming message
         during the chat chat session. <a href=#feature_10>Text to Speech and speech recognition in chat/groupChat session</a></li>
       <li><b>Heads-up Notification</b>: When there is an incoming call or an incoming message, a heads-up notification
         will pop-up. The heads-up notification is used by user to answer or dismiss an incoming call. In the case of
         the incoming message, the heads-up notification allow user to mark the message as read, or directly reply to
         the message without open the chat session. You may put the incoming message heads-up to snooze for half hour.
         <a href=#feature_12>aTalk Heads-Up Notification and Quiet-Hours</a></li>
       <li><b>Event Notification</b>: aTalk implements systray notifications for many of the incoming events e.g.
         incoming call (busy, missed, secured), incoming message etc. In many of these events, there are user defined
         alert options i.e. pop-up, playback sound, and vibrate. <a href=#feature_13>aTalk Notification Events</a></li>
     </ul>
   </div>

   <div class='innerText'><br/><b>Main user UI:</b></div>
   <div class='innerText'>Use slide left/right gesture on the main menu to access to the following pages i.e.:</div>

   </div>

   <div class='innerText'><b>Chat Sessions ViewPager:</b></div>
   <div class='innerText'>Whenever user opens a new chat session, the chat session view is automatically added to the
     chat session viewPager group. All the active chat sessions remain in viewPager until user closes the chat. When
     there are more than one active chat sessions, user may navigate between all active chat sessions by slide right/left
     gesture to navigate without exit the chat session view.</div>

   <div class='innerText'><b>Heads-up Notification</b></div>
   <div class='innerText'>Both aTalk incoming call and incoming message use android heads-up notifications as an UI
     interface for user action. In order for these two heads-up UI's to work properly, user must ensure both the android
     <image src="./img/atalk_heads-up_notification_setting.png" align="left" width="30%" style="margin:15px 15px 20px 0px"/>
     notifications for alert (sound) and pop-up are enabled; set the sound to 'Silent' and disable Vibrate, as aTalk
     has its own ring tone and vibrator handlers. Please refer to the attached screenshots for the correct android
     notification settings. The UI may be different pending on android OS version.</div>

   <div class='innerText'>By definition, if an xmpp client implementation follows XMPP standards as defined in

   <div class='blueText'>[20190731] What information to enter in "Override server setting" when I setup a new account? <a href=#content>{ Content }</a></div>
   <div class='innerText'>In today advance technology, a physical xmpp machine can actually support multiple virtual
    hosts/services. The virtual host/service name is usually tag with the user xmpp account e.g. alice@example.org, 
    where <b>example.org</b> is usually referred to as service domain or virtual host.</div>
    <image src="./img/atalk_account_setup.png" align="right" width="30%" style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px"/>
    <ul>
     <li> A Service record (SRV record) is a specification of data in the Domain Name System defining the location,
       i.e. the hostname and port number, of servers for specified services.</li>
   </ul>
   
   <div class='innerText'>If you leave the <b>Override server setting</b> option unchecked, aTalk first checks to
     ensure the specified service domain is reachable; it searches for the actual internet IP address on a Domain Name
     Server (DNS). On success, aTalk proceeds to lookup the SRV record on the server which contains the required
     ip:port network information for connection.</div>
     <div class='innerText'>Initial connection attempt will fail if neither of the following conditions is met, and
       you may need to enable the <b>Override server setting</b> option:</div>
    <ul>
     <li>The service domain host/server does not implement or contain the required SRV record</li>
     <li>The service domain name is a virtual host and is neither reachable nor listed in the DNS</li>
   </ul>
   <div class='innerText'>
     In the first case, aTalk uses the service domain resolved internet address and default port 5222 for connection.
     For server without SRV record implementation and connect via port other than 5222, you need to use
     <b>Override server setting</b> option. In <b>Connect Server IP</b> field, use service name of the xmpp account.
   </div>
   <div class='innerText'>
     In the second case, you need to specify the actual physical domain name i.e. Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)
     where the xmpp service resides. First check the <b>Override server setting</b> option, then enter the FQDN into
     the server setting <b>Connect Server IP</b> field. With this setup, aTalk will not look for SRV record on the
     service domain, instead it falls back to use the <b>Connect Server IP</b> resolved internet address for connection.
   </div>
   <div class='innerText'>
     <b>Note:</b> You may enter either a FQDN hostname or an IP address e.g. 115.66.84.204 in the <b>Connect Server IP</b>
     field. The user account name cannot contain IP address, use <b>Connect Server IP</b> instead to specify the IP
     address if the service domain name is not listed in DNS.

   <div class='blueText'>[20180818] SSL Certificate Authentication, DNSSEC and DANE Security Implementation for Connection Establishment
     <a href=#content>{ Content }</a></div>
   <div class='innerText'></div>
     <ul>
       <li><b>SSL Certificate Authentication</b>: The Secure Socket Layer (SSL), now technically known as Transport
         Layer Security (TLS) is a common building block for encrypted communications between clients and servers,
         basing on Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI) model. In a typical SSL/TLS usage scenario, a server is configured
         with a certificate containing a public key as well as a matching private key. During handshake between an SSL
         client and server, the server proves it has the private key by signing its certificate with public-key
         cryptography. However anyone can generate their own certificate and private key, hence this simple handshake
         doesn't prove anything about the server other than that the server knows the private key that matches the
         public key of the certificate. To address these downsides, the host platform generally contains a list of
         well known Certificate Authorities (CAs), and clients may only trust certificates that are signed by these CAs.
         However PKI is pruned to A Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack, and its implementation suffered also security
         breach by CAs. MitM is a cyber attack which takes place when a hacker (attacker) places himself between the
         client and the server and impersonates one of them. The DNSSEC and DANE attempt to alleviate these threats.</li>
       <li><b>DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions)</b>: The DNS is used to translate a FQDN domain names like example.org
         into numeric Internet addresses like 192.181.6.1, which can only be understood by router for a physical
         connection establishment. Unfortunately, the requestor/computer accepts any translated address given to it,
         without questions asked. This means existing DNS infrastructure is vulnerable to security issues; that allows
         an attacker to hijack this DNS process of looking a site up on the Internet using FQDN. The purpose of
         the attack is to take control of the session to, for example, send the user to the hijacker's own
         deceptive web site for account and password collection. Hence requirement to introduce a new DNSSEC
         technology to secure this part of the Internet's infrastructure.</li>
       <li><b>DANE (DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities)</b>: SSL/TLS encryption is currently based on
         certificates issued by certificate Authorities (CAs). Within the last few years, a number of CA providers
         suffered serious security breaches, allowing the issuance of certificates for well-known domains to those
         who don't own those domains. DANE enables the administrator of a domain name to certify the keys used in
         that domain's TLS clients or servers by storing them in the DNS TLSA Record. DANE needs the DNS records to
         be signed with DNSSEC for its security model to work, hence DANCE requires DNSSEC. Additionally DANE allows
         a domain owner to specify which CA is allowed to issue certificates for a particular resource, which solves
         the problem of any CA being able to issue certificates for any domain.</li>
      </ul>

   <div class='innerText'>aTalk supports the following connection establishment security mode. Please note
     that both DNSSEC and DANE implementations are still at experimental implementation by miniDNS/smack/aTalk. 
     DNSSEC does not work on server with a self-signed certificate or certificate signed by untrusted root CA's.
     You may refer to android Security Settings for a list of trusted CA certificates.</div>
     <ul>
       <li><b>SSL Certificate Authentication</b>: Perform only authentication of service's SSL certificate, verifying
         against the trusted root CAs who signed the certificate.</li>
       <li><b>DNSSEC</b>: Require all DNS information to be authenticated by DNSSEC; making connection only on success.</li>
       <li><b>DNSSEC and DANE</b>: Require all DNS information to be authenticated by DNSSEC, and require the XMPP
         service's SSL certificate to be verified using DANE.</li>

   <image src="./img/atalk_client_cert_config.png" align="left" width="30%" style="margin:5px 15px 0px 0px"/>
   <div class='innerText'>XMPP standard allows the use of any SASL mechanism in the authentication of XMPP entities.
     aTalk supports use of the SASL EXTERNAL mechanism with PKIX certificates for client to server authentication,
     especially when an XMPP service indicates that TLS is mandatory-to-negotiate. During the stream negotiation process,
     an XMPP client can present a certificate ("client certificate"), included with zero or more than one JabberID
     encapsulated as id-on-xmppAddr Object Identifier i.e "xmppAddr".</div>
   <image src="./img/atalk_client_cert_entry.png" align="right" width="30%" style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px"/>
   <div class='innerText'>The SASL EXTERNAL authentication method requires a digital client certificate. This digital
     certificate should contain xmppAddr field(s), which is always checked first. If there is more than one JID
     specified in the xmppAddr fields, the client must include the authorization entity which corresponds to the one
     of the specified JIDs. When no xmppAddr is specified, the cn (common name) field might be used to provide client's
     username. If the client certificate does not contain a JID, the client must provide one in authorization entity.
     For the details of the "xmppAddr" usage, please refer to
     <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0178.html">XEP-0178 Best Practices for Use of SASL EXTERNAL with Certificates.</a></div>
   <div class='innerText'><b>Self-signed certificates for regular TCP/TLS connections:</b> If your xmpp service accepts
     self-signed certs for connection, you may use the following method to generate the client certificate:</div>
     <ul>
       <li>openssl genrsa -des3 -out rootCA.key 4096</li>
       <li>openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key rootCA.key -sha256 -days 1024 -out rootCA.crt</li>

       <li>openssl x509 -req -in client.csr -CA rootCA.crt -CAkey rootCA.key -CAcreateserial -out client.crt -days 500 -sha256</li>
       <li>openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey client.key -in client.crt -out client.p12</li>

   <div class='innerText'>Bidirectional-streams Over Synchronous HTTP (BOSH) is a transport protocol that emulates a
     bidirectional stream between two entities (such as a client and a server) by using multiple synchronous HTTP
     request/response pairs without requiring the use of frequent polling or asynchronous chunked responses.</div>
     <image src="./img/atalk_bosh_proxy_configuration.png" align="right" width="30%" style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px"/>
   <div class='innerText'>Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol
     (HTTP). It is used for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the Internet. In HTTPS,
     the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS), or formerly its predecessor Secure
     Sockets Layer (SSL). The protocol is therefore also often referred to as HTTP over TLS or HTTP over SSL.</div>
   <div class='innerText'>Most companies restrict their internet access for their employees with a firewall and proxy.
     Normally only port 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) are opened, which means no access to the xmpp port 5222. With aTalk
     xmpp client, you can tunnel through the firewall to reach your desired xmpp server via BOSH connection.</div>
   <div class='innerText'>
       For Bosh to work on aTalk properly, the xmpp server certificate must be issued by Certification
       Authority (CA) trusted by android. The trusted CAs list can be accessed via <b>View security certificates</b>
       in android Setting. If android OS detects an untrusted certificate during network connection, it will deny access
       via https:// scheme protocol, and BOSH connection is not possible. Starting with Android 9 (API-28), cleartext
       support is disabled by default. BOSH connection via http:// scheme protocol is not supported by aTalk on these
       devices. 
   </div>
   <div class='innerText'>aTalk client supports the following BOSH standards:

   <div class='innerText'>Below gives a brief description on how to setup BOSH for an xmpp user. From aTalk main menu,
     select <b>Account settings...</b>. Follow the instructions herein on how to create a new account. By default aTalk
     will connect to the user server via XMPPTCP connection on first login. You will need to cancel the login prompt

       <li>The default configuration is <b>NONE</b>. Select <b>BOSH</b> from the <b>Type</b> pull down menu</li>
       <image src="./img/atalk_bosh_proxy_option.png" align="right" width="20%" style="margin:5px 0px 5px 15px"/>
       <li>Enter the <b>BOSH URL</b> link e.g. https://example.net:443/http-bind. You need to refer to the xmpp service
         provider to find the correct setting.</li>
       <li>If the firewall was your only problem, then you are done with the BOSH settings. If not, you then have to
         configure the Proxy settings too.</li>
       <li>There is a checkbox <b>Use HTTP-Proxy</b> in the dialog when you enable BOSH option. Choose this
         checkbox and enter the proxy data. Enter the authentication info if needed. Leave both the

     </ul>
   <div class='innerText'>A proxy server is a dedicated computer system or router that acts as an intermediary between
     an endpoint device, such as a computer, and another server from which a user or client is requesting a service.
     Proxy servers are used for the following purposes.</div>
   <div class='innerText'>In the enterprise, a proxy server is used to facilitate security, administrative control or
     caching services, among other purposes. In a personal computing context, proxy servers are used to enable user

     undermine user privacy.</div>
   <div class='innerText'>To the user, the proxy server is transparent; all Internet requests and returned responses
     appear to be directly with the addressed Internet server. The proxy is not actually invisible; its IP address
     has to be specified as a configuration option to the browser or other protocol program. You may use and setup
     proxy only if you do not need BOSH connection</b>

   <div class='blueText'>Do I have to enable IB Registration option when I setup a new account? <a href=#content>{ Content }</a></div>
   <div class='innerText'> <image src="./img/atalk_ibr_captcha.png" align="right" width="30%" style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px"/></div>
   <div class='innerText'>"IB Registration" stands for "In-Band Registration" and is defined in
   <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0077.html">XEP-0077</a> standard. In general, if an account already has
     been created and assigned to you by your server administrator, you do not need to enable IBR option during account
     setup. This is usually not true if you want to register an account on an online free xmpp server. Some server
     needs you to create an account via their web interface before you can setup the account on your xmpp client.
     If the server supports IBR, then you can create and register a new user account from within aTalk in one
     single step. When you setup an account with IBR enabled, aTalk does a pre-check whether the account exist on
     the server, and proceed with the IBR only if the login failed with exception &lt;not-authorized/&gt;.
   </div>
   <div class='innerText'>A few points to note when doing IBR registration as most server has the following rules set:
     <ul>
       <li>If you selected IBR but entered mis-spelled user name or password during login, aTalk will also prompt
          you with an IBR dialogue even the account already exists on the server. For security reason, xmpp server
          always throws the same exception i.e &lt;not-authorized/&gt; for both "Invalid username or password"
          and "non-existence" account on server.</li>
       <li>Server will reject IBR registration for an account already exists on the server with:
          "XMPPError: conflict - cancel: User already exists" or similar. Click OK and aTalk will prompt you with
          the login screen. Check your password entry before trying to login.</li>
       <li> Many of the xmpp servers have a default connection timeout of 30 seconds, therefore you need to response
          to the Captcha challenge within this time period. When timeout happens, just click OK to retry</li>
       <li>Password Strength: Minimum informational entropy for passwords. The value Entropy is a number of bits
          of entropy. The recommended minimum is 32 bits. Server will reject weak password entry. Just click
          OK to retry with new password entry.</li>
       <li>Registration Timeout: This limits the frequency of registration from a given IP or username.
          So, a user that tries to register a new account from the same IP address or JID during this timeout
          after his previous registration will receive an error resource-constraint with the explanation:
          “Users are not allowed to register accounts so quickly”. Default value is usually 600 seconds.
          You need to try it later after the registration timeout has expired.</li>

   <div class='innerText'>Most of the servers today have SSL certificates installed on their sites. The certificates
      usually are signed with the private key of a trusted certificate authority. The certificate contains the
      domain name and/or ip address of the server. When you visit the site, this certificate is fetched and
      compared against the public keys of all the major certificate authorities; and confirms with the certificate
      authority that the address listed in the certificate is the one to which it has an open connection.</div>

   <div class='innerText'>In aTalk, when you setup an account and sign in on new server, android OS checks for the site
     certificate validity during the SSL secure socket connection setup. If the site certificate is signed by a trusted
     certificate authority and is also listed in android certified trusted authority list; android proceeds normally
     with the SSL socket connection, otherwise it throws Certificate Exception.</div>

    <div class='innerText'>aTalk captures this Certificate Exception thrown by android OS when the certificate is self-signed.
      aTalk then downloads the site certificate and check against its database. It prompts user for manual confirmation
      if the certificate is new to aTalk as shown on the right i.e. <b>Certificate Verification.</b>. You can proceed 
      with login by clicking on the <b>Proceed</b> button. Under this condition, the certificate info is not saved
      in aTalk database, and you will be prompted again in your next login.</div>

      <div class='innerText'>Alternatively, you can click the <b>Show Certification</b> button, the site certificate is

   <div class='innerText'><br/><b>Adding Contact Process Flow:</b></div>
   <div class='innerText'>When you add a buddy to your contact list, aTalk actually makes an online subscription
     request to your buddy for his/her approval. In this process, your hosted server routes your subscription request
     on local machine if the buddy is of the same server; otherwise via remote connection to the buddy hosted
     server. The server-to-server (s2s) connection setup uses the IP derived from your buddy account service name
     i.e. example.org from "buddy@example.org". If the derived domain is not a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)
     and canno be resolved to an IP, the subscription request process will fail.</div>
   <div class='innerText'>With the current XMPP standard defined for
     Presence Subscription, it is therefore not possible to add buddy whom resides on a different server
     where his/her account JID does not contain the FQDN. You are also unable to send message to your buddy in
     this case since the message is delivered via s2s network connection.</div>
   <image src="./img/atalk_contact_presence_approval.png" align="right" width="30%" style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px"/>
   <div class='innerText'>When you receive the Presence Subscription Request from your buddy via the hosted server, an 
     <b>Authorization Request</b> dialogue is launched for your approval. You may Ignore, Deny or Authorize the request.
     If you accept your buddy request, reciprocally a Presence Subscription Request will be reverted by aTalk to your
     buddy for approval. Meantime your buddy will receive the acknowledgment of your acceptance.</div>
  <div class='innerText'>In the event if you choose to ignore your buddy request; any further re-authorization request
     from your buddy will not trigger another Authorization Request. However the server will resend the request 
     when you exit and login again. This process continues until you have made a decision either to Deny
     or Authorize the request.</div>
     <image src="./img/atalk_contact_presence_auto.png" align="right" width="30%" style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px"/>
   <div class='innerText'>Instead of manually approve upon each received Subscription Request, you may made this process
     automatically, by enable the option <b>Presence subscribe approval</b> auto accept all in the [menu | Settings...].
     In this case, aTalk automatically approves upon received a Presence Subscription Request from your
     buddy. It will also revert a request to your buddy for approval.</div>
   <div class='innerText'><b>Note:</b> When you remove a buddy from your contact list, it automatically triggers the
     server to remove him/her from your Presence Subscription.

   <div class='innerText'>Your XMPP service admin may choose to create share-rosters on the server, grouping all the
    related members in each categorid roster group. Upon first login, every member of the group will have his/her

    to everyone in the related entity.</div>

     The initial contact list is only populated with contacts from the roster, if any defined by the administrator. However
     one can add him/herself as one of the contacts via the <b>Add contact</b> option, just like adding other contact;
     all messages conversed with other contacts will not appear in the oneself chat session. You are not able

     direction for a 360° panoramic view of the current select location on the map.</div>
   <div class='innerText'> The <b>Follow me</b> location fetch/update is determined by two parameters defined by user
     i.e. <b>Distance Delta</b> and <b>Elapsed Time</b> using the horizontal sliders. Both conditions must be met
     before a new location fix is fetched/displayed. The <b>Follow me</b> text flashes while this mode is activate.
     User must manually stop the <b>Follow me</b> update when not in use, else the location updates will continue
     in background. This will consume battery, and data usage if share option is checked.</div>

   <div class='blueText'>[20200330] XEP-0045: Multi-User Chat <a href=#content>{ Content }</a></div>
   <div class='innerText'>Multi-User Chat (MUC) or group chat protocols are defined in XMPP XEP-0045 specifications;
     several users participate in room discussion can exchange chat messages at the same time. aTalk implements most
     of the room common features for MUC messaging. Please refer to <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0045.html">XEP-0045: Multi-User Chat</a>
      for more information. Followings are few of the terminologies pertaining to MUC operations.
   <div class='innerText'> <image src="./img/atalk_groupchat_invitation.png" align="right" width="30%" style="margin:5px 0px 15px 15px"/></div>
     <ul>
         <li><b>Invitation:</b> A dedicated message that is sent from one user to another asking the recipient to join
           a chat room. aTalk displays this invitation message as shown on the right, to the recipient for his/her action.</li>
         <li><b>Room Member:</b> A user who is on the "whitelist" for a members-only room or whom has been registered
           with a MUC room.</li>
         <li><b>Members-Only Room:</b> A room where a user cannot enter without being on the member list. Only the room
           owner or room configuration that has granted the privileges to member can invite user to join the member-only
           room. An non-member attempts to join will automatically be rejected by the room management. To support OMEMO
           message chat, the room must be configured as members-only room</li>
         <li><b>Persistent Room:</b> A room that is not destroyed by server even the last occupant has exited.</li>
         <li><b>Occupant:</b> Any user who is in a room, uses &lt;room@service/nick> by which an occupant is identified
           within the context of a room.</li>
         <li><b>Participant: </b> An occupant who does not have admin status; in a moderated room, a participant is
           further defined as having voice, in contrast to a visitor.</li>
         <li><b>Room Owner:</b> The user who has created the room or a user who has been designated by the room creator
           or owner as someone with owner status; an owner is allowed to change the room configuration and destroy
           the room, in addition to all admin status.</li>
         <li><b>Discussion History:</b> Depending on service policy or room configuration, a room may send discussion
           history to the newly joined occupant. Whether such history is sent, and how many messages comprise the
           history, are determined by the chat service implementation or specific deployment depending on local service
           policy or room configuration. aTalk can receive and display all the history messages, while removing any
           previously received duplicated messages.
           <br/>Note: When a group chat is setup for OMEMO chat messages, the history messages which are sent to a newly
           joined participant cannot be decrypted nor displayed, as the history encrypted messages do not contain the
           rid key information. The rid key is required to decrypt an OMEMO encrypted message.</li>

   <div class='innerText'>The privilege of a registered user to create a new room on server is defined by the XMPP
     server configuration set by the administrator. In aTalk, with the right privilege, you may create a new room
     using one of the two methods described below.</div> 
   <div class='innerText'> <image src="./img/atalk_muc_join.png" align="left" width="30%" style="margin:5px 25px 5px 0px"/></div>
   <div class='innerText'><b>Create / Join Chat Room:</b> Select this option from the main menu to create a new or
     join an existing room on the server. You need to provide a Nick Name, if necessary update the room subject if
     permitted pending room configuration settings. You must also provide a valid password when the room is configured
     with password protected. Check the <b>Save password</b> if you do not want to re-enter the password whenever you
     rejoin the room at a later time. If you edited the room name in the selector, aTalk will proceed to create a new
     room when you click the <b>Join</b> button. The creation of a new room may fail if you do have the privilege to do so.</div>
   <div class='innerText'><b>Converting 1:1 chat into a group chat:</b> While in a chat session with a buddy, there may
     a need to have more people to join the discussion i.e. convert a 1:1 chat session into a multi-user conference.
     To do this, just select <b>Invite</b> option from the pull-down menu; you then add the existing buddy and other
     contacts to the chat room. A new chat room will be created, and invitation sent to all the participants selected.
     <br/>Note: the chat history discussed thus far prior to the new room creation are not sent automatically under
     this case. User needs to perform copy and past of any message to share if so desire.</div>
   <div class='innerText'><b>Room configuration:</b> By default, all new rooms created by aTalk support OMEMO chat,
     hence it is designated as members-only room. However after a new room has been created, you may proceed to change
     the room configuration as required e.g. to include password protection and make it a persistent room etc</div>
   <div class='innerText'><b>Note:</b> If you attempt to join a member-only or not public room while you are not in
     the room member list, the process will failed with an error message. You will no be able to receive or send any

   <div class='innerText'> <image src="./img/atalk_http_auth_demo.png" align="right" width="30%" style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px"/></div>
   <div class='innerText'>HTTP (RFC 2616) is a nearly-ubiquitous mechanism for the publication and retrieval of information
     over the Internet. Sometimes it is appropriate for an HTTP Server to allow access to its site information only if
     the HTTP client first provides authentication credentials. While there exist several standardized HTTP authentication
     schemes (RFC 2617), it may be useful in some applications to enforce verification of an HTTP request by requiring
     an XMPP entity (normally an IM user) to confirm that it made the request.</div>
   <div class='innerText'><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0070.html"><b>XEP-0070</b></a> specification defines
     an XMPP protocol extension that enables verification of an HTTP request via XMPP. The XEP-0070 request verification
     can be combined with native HTTP authentication to provide a stronger association between the request and a particular
     user; as well as to take advantage of the strong user authentication provided in XMPP.</div>
   <div class='innerText'>aTalk since v1.8.8 has implemented the XEP-0070 protocol and integrated a webView within the
    application. To have a better understanding the operation of XEP-0070, there actually exist an online demo site i.e.
    <a href="https://blog.agayon.be/xmpp_auth_django_demo.html">Demo Website: Authentication with XMPP</a> for this
    purpose.</div>
   <div class='innerText'>Folowing details the steps to show XEP-0070 demo on aTalk.
        <ul>
         <li>From the [main menu | Settings... | Web Access Page], enter the following site link <b>https://demo.agayon.be/</b></li>
         <li>Exit main menu, then slide left until you arrive at the webView page.</li>
         <li>aTalk will automatic load the defined webpage that you have entered earlier.</li>
         <li>Click the <b>login</b> link on the webpage, login page as shown on the right will be displayed.</li>
         <li>In the <b>Username</b> field, enter the xmpp user account that you are currently login.</li>
         <li>Then clik the <b>Sign In</b> button on the webPage.</li>
         <li>Via s2s connection, the visiting site sends the XMPP Server Requests Confirmation via XMPP protocol. Pending
           whether the entered user account ends with/without a resource; the site sends either an IQ stanza or a Message
           stanza request to the login entity.</li>
         <image src="./img/atalk_http_auth_request.png" align="right" width="30%" style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px"/>
         <li><b>Http Authorization Request</b> as shown on the left is returned if you have entered the username ends with
           a resource. A similar one will be shown if the username is entered without a resource attribute, its dialogue
           content is defined by the site admin. The demo site actually supports client that does not implement
           XEP-0070 to just reply chat message with the ID for authorization confirmation.</li>
      </ul>
   </div>
   <div class='innerText'><b>Note:</b> The XMPP HTTP Authorization request is sent via s2s connection, therefore you
     must ensure that the user account virtual host (i.e. domain part of the account) must be resolved to a valid IP. 
     Otherwise the HTTP will not be able to reach you.</div>
   <div class='innerText'><br/><b>aTalk integrated WebView Interface: </b>aTalk has also integrated a WebView interface
     within the application. When user slides left until this WebView is in view, it automatically loads the sitez
     address as defined in the main Settings....</div>
     <image src="./img/atalk_http_auth_signin.png" align="right" width="30%" style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px"/>
   <div class='innerText'> The purpose of the WebView is to allow an organization to display its official web page. The
     page can be used to provide the organization latest news update and even for RSS feed. By default, if you leave
     the main Settings... <b>Web Access Page</b> blank, aTalk automatically loads the movim page. From here you can
     sign in to the site for their news update, RSS feed, chat etc.</div>
   <div class='innerText'>When a HTTP Server allows user access to the information only if the HTTP Client first
     provides an authentication credentials, aTalk will pop up <b>Sign In</b> form as shown on the right for uer to login.
     Like normal browser, you can navigate and click links that appear in the page. aTalk webView will refresh the
     page with the new page. For security reason, however aTalk will only load the page within aTalk application if the
     new link host address is the same as defined in the user setting; otherwise it will use android default browser
     for the web page display.</div>
   <div class='innerText'>You can go back to the previous page by using the <b>Back Press</b> button; or slide right
    to leave the WebView and return to other slider pages. If you change the <b>Web Access Page</b> settings, you must
    navigate the slider to the Contact list page. This is to trigger android OS to invalidate the last accessed web page.
    Only then, WebView can load the new user defined web page.</div>

   <div class='blueText'>[20230211] XEP-0313: Message Archive Management <a href=#content>{ Content }</a></div>
   <div class='innerText'>aTalk has added support for Message Archive Management since aTalk v3.1.2. Take note the
    followings to understand MAM implementation, and for it to work properly on aTalk:
     <ul>
     <ul>
       <li>The user registered server must support XEP-0313 MAM of all chat messages.</li>
       <li>The MAM supported is not available on aTalk when user has the <b>Chat hitory logging</b> option disabled.</li>
       <li>When user changes <b>Chat hitory logging</b> option while offline, the MAM setting on server will not be
         updated until next user login. If user enables <b>Chat hitory logging</b> option while offline, and exit aTalk
         after that. None of the MAM messages sent to the user will be saved on the server for later retrieval when
         user goes online.</li>
       <li>The retrieval of MAM messages can only be done while the user is online and registered with the server.</li>
     </ul></div>

   <div class='innerText'>In aTalk MAM implementation, MAM messages are fetched only ONCE, when the user newly launches
     the chat session for the specific contact. Currently aTalk allows launching the chat session even when user is
     offline; this is to allow the offline user to view the chat history messages. Under this case, no MAM message is
     being fetched nor displayed in the chatSession UI. These MAM messages, if any will remain on the server even after
     user has later registered with the server. For display of MAM messages, after user has registered with the server,
     user must close the current chat session and launch again for aTalk to retrieve the MAM messages and display on
     the chatSession UI.</div>

   <div class='blueText'>[20230211] aTalk Fault-Tolerance File Sharing Implementation &amp; Enhancements <a href=#content>{ Content }</a></div>
   <div class='innerText'>aTalk file sharing implementation uses the following XEP protocols:
     <li><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0234.html">XEP-0234: Jingle File Transfer</a></li>
     <li><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0096.html">XEP-0096: SI File Transfer</a></li>
     <li><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0363.html">XEP-0363: HTTP File Upload</a></li>
     <li><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0264.html">XEP-0264: Jingle Content Thumbnails</a></li>
     <li><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0391.html">XEP-0391: Jingle Encrypted Transports</a></li>
     <li><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/inbox/omemo-media-sharing.html">XEP-xxxx: OMEMO Media Sharing</a></li>
   </div>
   <div class='innerText'>aTalk supports send and receive files for all document types and images. There is an option
     to enable thumbnail preview for media file i.e. image and video before the actual file is being sent. To send or
     receipt of thumbnail, both the sender and recipient devices must have this option enabled; and the transfer file
     size is larger than the 'Auto accept max file size'. The actual file is sent upon acceptance by your buddy. aTalk
     allows automatic acceptance of file transfer request or stickers sending if the size of the file to be transferred
     is less than or equal to the user defined max file size option.<br/>
     Note: Thumbnail sending is only available for SI File Transfer protocol. </div>
   <div class='innerText'><image src="./img/atalk_file_sharing.png" align="right" width="30%" style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px"/></div>
   <div class='innerText'>aTalk implements intelligent fault-tolerance file sharing algorithm. aTalk file sharing methods
     include the use of <b>Jingle File Transfer</b> and legacy <b>SI File Transfer</b> protocols supporting both the
     SOCK5 and IBB BytesStreams options; and together with <b>HTTP File Upload service</b> to ensure reliability.
     Files encryption using OMEMO are supported in both the Jingle File Transfer via XEP-0391: Jingle Encrypted
     Transports, and HTTP File Upload via XEP-xxxx: OMEMO Media Sharing. aTalk file transfer handling priority order
     is as follow:</br></br>
     <li>Jingle File Transfer with JET support (online and supported by recipient client)</li>
     <li>HTTP File Upload (if supported by service provider) when recipient is offline, and for JFT/JET fallback</li>
     <li>SI File Transfer; fallback to IBB on SOCK5 failure</li><br/>
   </div>

   <div class='innerText'><image src="./img/atalk_file_xfer_prompt.png" align="right" width="30%" style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px"/></div>
   <div class='innerText'>During file transfer negotiation, aTalk uses the agreed protocol per above defined priorty
     for sharing the file. However if the agreed protocol method failed for reason e.g. client symmetric NAT firewall,
     aTalk automatically fallback to use <b>HTTP File Upload service</b> to ensure a successful file transfer.</div>
   <div class='innerText'>aTalk supports both the <b>Jingle Encrypted Transports</b> and <b>OMEMO Media Sharing</b>
     protocol. During 1:1 OMEMO chat session, it uses Jingle File Trasfer with JET if supported by the remote client. 
     In muc OMEMO chat session, all file sharing will be encrypted using <b>OMEMO Media Sharing</b> before sending via
     <b>HTTP File Upload</b> service.</div>
   <div class='innerText'>In the event if the remote client advertised e.g conversations, but does not support the
    XEP-0391: JET protocol. The trasfer failed with user retry. aTalk will automatic proceed to use the
    <b>HTTP File Upload service</b> for the next 10 files sharing with your buddy.</div>
   <div class='innerText'><image src="./img/atalk_file_xfer_failed.png" align="right" width="30%" style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px"/></div>
   <div class='innerText'>When aTalk detects the remote is offline, it automatically selects the HTTP File Upload
     facility, if the protocol is supported by your xmpp service provider, to continue with the file transfer.</div>
   <div class='innerText'>Both XEP-0234: Jingle File Transfer and XEP-0096: SI File Transfer specification have no
     provision to transfer file when you are in a muc/conference session. Under this condition, aTalk checks the server
     for HTTP File Upload service support, and uses it if available to support file sharing between muc members.</div>
   <div class='innerText'>aTalk harmonizes and uses a common UI in file sharing, irrespective of which file sharing
     protocols is being used, and for all the various chat sessions. The file transfer status UI display is always in
     synchronise with the actual file transfer protocol state changes, byte send/receive progress status, file encryption
     type etc. The file transfer UI is always in foucs and fully visible to user, override android UI refresh limitation
     i.e. android does not realign the focus on view holder size change;
     </div>
   <div class='innerText'>Unlike all other file transfer protocols, when file transfer is via <b>HTTP File Upload service</b>,
     the sender is unaware of the recipient status, with no protocol handshake in place. After the sender has succcesfully
     uploaded the file to the server, it forwards the file download link embedded as a chat message to the recipient.
     To allow recipient to retrieve the file, aTalk always shows the received file download link as a file transfer offer.
     Selecting the <b>Decline</b> button does not actually delete the file link message, except UI changes to show user
     has declined the file offer. If the user make a copy from the file transfer UI, and paste in the text entry. The
     actual url link is shown. For an unencrypted file transfer, user can click the link to fetch the file via web UI.
     However user is unable to fetch an encrypted file via this method once the user has declined the file offer.</div>

   <div class='innerText'>aTalk supports speech synthesis from an incoming chat messages for immediate playback
     during chat or group chat session. To allow speech synthesis on an incoming message, user must enable both the
     global TTS and the specific chat session option for speech playback. The global TTS option is accessed via the
     main menu <b>General TTS settings...</b>. The main TTS settings menu provides the following options:</div>
     <ul>
       <li><b>Default TTS voice:</b> displays the current selected voice speech. During playback of the text message,
         android auto-detect the text language type and playback with the correct spoken language. However android

       <li><b>Message Text to Speech delay (ms)</b>In android, all notification alerts always have higher priority over
         any other media including the speech playback. aTalk waits for this specified delay (ms) before starting the
         text to speech synthesis. If you enable and change the incoming message alert to other than the default,
         then adjust this duration until the start of the text speech is not being clipped by the alert.</li>
       <li><b>Enable Text &#x27A1; Speech</b> You must check this global option to enable TTS feature on aTalk. If you
         do not enable this global option, then the <b>Enable/Disable Text &#x27A1; Speech</b> option for the chat

   <div class='innerText'>Starting in Android 8.0 (API level 26), android has enforced that all notifications must be
     assigned to a channel. For each channel, user can set the visual and auditory behavior that is applied to all
     notifications in that channel. Users can change these settings and decide which notification channels from the
     app should be visible at all. In aTalk implementation, users are given full control to all the notification evetns
     as explain above. You may ignore the android notification channel.</div>

   <div class='innerText'>In wireless communications, fading is variation of signal with time, geographical position,
     and radio frequency. Fading is frequent in mobile devices and may cause momentarily newtork data lost or
     disconnection. To improve network communication reliablity and minimize data lost, aTalk implements both
     XEP-0198: Stream Management and Reconnection Manager.</div>
   <div class='innerText'>In Stream Management, all stanza data exchanges between client and server are verified
     and acknowledged. When a stanza data is lost during fading, either entities will attempt to resend stanza data
     that has not been acknowledged by the recipient.
   </div>
   <div class='innerText'>In event that a sudden lost of network connection is detected, Reconnection Manager will
     automatically start the reconnection sequence using the algorithm defined below:</div>
     <ul>
         <li>at 5~15 seconds interval for 6 attempts</li>
         <li>at 30~90 seconds interval for next 6 attempts</li>
         <li>at 2.5~7.5 mins interval until connection is established successfully</li>
      </ul>
   <div class='innerText'>aTalk requires network connection in standby mode in order to receive messages or media
     calls. If you disable all network connection during device standy, reconnection manager will kick in once it detects
     network lost, and continues until you manually exit aTalk. Do ensure either GSM network or WiFi network remains
     accessible when device goes into standby mode. If all network is disabled in standy mode, you may also need to
     restart aTalk when device is waked up.</div>
     <div class='innerText'>Some of the availabe power saving mode that may affect aTalk operation during standby,
       options may vary depending on android device and OS version: 

      <ul>
         <li>Disabling Doze & App Standby for aTalk: Settings - Device maintenance - Battery - Unmonitored apps</li>

   <div class='blueText'>[20181015] Network Keep Alive - Ping Interval Optimization <a href=#content>{ Content }</a></div>
   <div class='innerText'>Most of the newtwork service provider inherently closes mobile devices TCP socket connection
     when it detects there is no data exchange activity for some elapse of time. The established internet TCP
     connection channel with the server may also be removed by the network after some idle time. If you find that your
     device is unable to receive messages in realtime or/and with aTalk goes offline frequently; you will need to go
     to [Account Settings... | Connection Settings] to select the <b>Enable Keep Alive option</b> and set the
     <b>Ping Interval</b> that is lower than the newtork data inactivity timer for your internet service provider.
     A good starting value is 240-second for the ping interval; and tweak the value if necessary with 20-second steps
     for the optimal device performance.
   </div>
   <div class='innerText'><image src="./img/atalk_ping_setting.png" align="right" width="30%" style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px"/></div>
   <div class='innerText'>aTalk has implemented an user option <b>Enable Ping Interval optimization</b> to
    allow aTalk to auto tune and optimize the Ping Interval time for network connection for each user account.
    This option is enabled by default until user disables it. The Ping Interval optimization is active only when
    your device is connected to the service provider via the mobile network connection. No optimization will be 
    performed when the device is connected via WiFi; During testing, no ping failure is detected when the device
    is connected via WiFi-LAN to the service provider.</div>
    <div class='innerText'>Following gives a brief description on the Ping Interval Optmization procedure with
      inital setting of 300s (or 5 minutes) </div>
      <ul>
        <li>aTalk ping the server at the regular interval as specified e.g. 300s</li>
        <li>When ping to server failed for 3 consequetive attempts @10s interval i.e. to take care network fading</li>
        <li>Lower and use new Ping Interval i.e. use step size of -30s if &gt;240s, else use step size of -10s </li>
        <li>Stop optimization if no further ping failure is detected or until min Ping Interval of 120s is reached</li>
      </ul>
    <div class='innerText'>Manual tuning is needed when &lt;120s is required. When optimization is completed or you
     want to set Ping Interval manually, you may disable <b>Enable Ping Interval optimization</b> option.</div>

   <div class='innerText'><b>Note:</b> When an established TCP data channel is terminated by network, neither android
     nor aTalk is able to detect this condition, until it failed while attempting to send data. Therefore Reconnection
     Manager is not being triggered when the TCP data channel is removed. It is therefore necessary to send the
     keep alive ping at regular interval to detect this condition for Reconnection Manager to work.</div>

   <div class='innerText'>Starting with Android 6.0 Marshmallow (API 23), a new runtime permission model has been
     introduced; Users are not prompted for permissions at the time of installing the app, rather app needs to check
     for and request permissions at runtime. Users can then allow or deny the permissions for the app. Users can also
     grant or revoke permission anytime from within the android settings to override the permission granted during
     aTalk permission requests.</div>
   <div class='innerText'>Whenever user launches aTalk on Android-M or higher, it prompts the user to grant if there is
     any missing required permission. For aTalk maximum performance and full features support, aTalk requires the user
     to grant permissions for the following services.</div>
      <ul>
         <li>Camera - for video call or capture picture or record video for sharing</li>
         <li>Contacts - needed for phone state access and call setup e.g. telephony</li>

           <b> Note:</b> Fdroid version support Location sharing with street map view only.</li>
         <li>Audio - audio chat, voice and video calls</li>
         <li>Phone - phone features support - telephony gateway</li>
         <li>Storage - Access to android local storage for saving aTalk vital operational data and files. aTalk will
         fail unexpectly if this basic permission is denied.</li>
      </ul>

   <image src="./img/atalk_permission_dontaskagain.png" align="right" width="30%" style="margin:0px 0px 5px 15px"/>
   <div class='innerText'>If any of the permissions is denied, aTalk may not work properly or may have unexpected

   <div class='innerText'>Followings are also hold truth on aTalk reacts to the permissions grants.
      <ul>
         <li>aTalk will always prompt for permission grant if none are set to permanently denied on every aTalk
           new launch. This is to take care of users whom had unintentionally denied the permission on initial use;
           later want to use features that required new permissions. Normally user should not <b>Exit</b> aTalk as this
           ends and termates aTalk completely. Instead user should use <b>Back Button</b> to close aTalk window.</li>
         <image src="./img/atalk_battery_opt_warn.png" align="right" width="30%" style="margin:5px 0px 5px 15px"/>
         <li>aTalk will repeatedly prompts user for actions if there are less than 3 permissions being granted even
           users had permanently denied them. Most aTalk features will not operate properly under these condition.
           If you understand and accept aTalk unexpected behavior, but do not wish to be bothered by aTalk
           repeated permission prompts; then always use <b>Back Button</b> to close aTalk window.</li>
         <li>It was found that some android devices have incorrectly implemented the <b>PERMANENTLY DENIED</b> options;
           hence aTalk will always prompt user for permission grants even the above conditions are being met. 
           It seems that the affected android devices have init all requested permissions to <b>PERMANENTLY DENIED</b>

      </ul>
   </div>

   <div class='innerText'><b>Disabling Doze & App Standby for aTalk</b></div>
   <div class='innerText'>Battery optimization is a function (known as Doze) built into Android 6.0 Marshmallow and above.
     It preserves battery life by limiting what apps can do when the device is in standby (doze mode). You must not put
     aTalk under android battery optimization. Otherwise android OS will put aTalk to sleep (offline) when the device
     <image src="./img/atalk_battery_opt_prompt.png" align="right" width="30%" style="margin:5px 0px 5px 15px"/>
     is in standby mode. When this happen, aTalk will not alert you when there are new messages sent from your buddy.
     All messages will be delayed and received as offline messages when aTalk is online again. Your buddy cannot set up
     media call with you as aTalk appears offline to the buddy.</div>
   <div class='innerText'>Whenever user launches aTalk on Android-M or higher, aTalk will alert user if it detects
     aTalk has been put under android battery optimization. Click <b>Next</b> and select <b>Allow</b> on android prompt.</div>

   <div class='innerText'><b>Note</b>: If you change any of the resouce permissions via android <b>Settings</b>, you

   <div class='innerText'>The Voice over IP (VoIP) and other media applications uses Real-time Transfer Protocol (RTP).
     Many VoIP applications send RTP data over the public Internet in clear, thus the data is not protected from
     eavesdropping or modification. Therefore most VoIP applications are considered insecure today. aTalk supports SRTP
     and ZRTP etc to enhance the security for VoIP communications.</div>
       <ul>
         <li><b>ZRTP</b>: Media Path Diffie-Hellman session key exchange Agreement for Unicast Secure RTP, is a
           protocol that negotiates the keys and other information required to setup a SRTP audio and video session,
           without additional infrastructure, server programs, registration, and alike. It indicates to the VoIP user
           if a session is secure or not, inform about problems and thier severity. ZRTP cannot automatically
           authenticate the end-users, this is task of the users once they can talk to each other.</li>
         <li><b>SRTP</b>: Secure Real-time Transfer Protocol enhances security for RTP and provides integrity and
           privacy for RTP media connections. To use SRTP in an efficient way, VoIP applications should be
           able to negotiate keys and other parameters automatically.

                 rely on TLS for the establishment of keys, Diffie-Hellman key agreement takes place and key
                 verification is done by verifying "fingerprints" in the form of short strings. You can think of this
                 as the voice equivalent of OTR</li>
               <li><b>DTLS_SRTP</b>: This is another way to negotiate keys but rather than use an extension to SIP
                 to do it, SIP simply indicates the media stream uses DTLS-SRTP and key negotiation happens in the
                 media stream. Key negotiation happens as in TLS and thus relies on PKI.</li>

           CipherSuite.TLS_ECDHE_RSA... since v3.1.0. ECDSA and RSA are two of most widely adopted asymmetric algorithms, and are used
           in aTalk DTLS_SRTP SSL/TLS certificates generation. ECDSA provides the same level of security as RSA but it
           does so while using much shorter key lengths. Therefore, for longer keys, ECDSA will take considerably more
           time to crack through brute-forcing attacks. Another advantage that ECDSA offers over RSA is the advantage
           of performance and scalability. As ECC gives optimal security with shorter key lengths, it requires a lesser
           load for network and computing power. For more reading:

   <div class='innerText'>A device uses <b>Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)</b> to discover its public IP
     address and type of firwall when it is located behind a NAT/Firewall. It then uses this information to assist in
     establishing peer-to-peer VoIP connectivity.</div>
   <div class='innerText'>While STUN is effective in addressing the NAT issue with most consumer NAT devices (routers),
     it doesn’t work effectively for many corporate networks. If the NAT/Firewall would not allow the two hosts to
     connect directly, they make a connection to a server implementing <b>Traversal Using Relay around NAT (TURN)</b>,
     which will relay media between the two end-points. </div>
   <div class='innerText'><b>Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)</b> is a framework that describes how to
     coordinate STUN and TURN to make a connection between two end-points. </div>
   <div class='innerText'><b>Jingle</b> specification defines an XMPP protocol extension for initiating and managing
     peer-to-peer (P2P) media sessions between two XMPP entities in a way that is interoperable with existing Internet
     standards.</div>
   <div class='innerText'><b>Universal Plug and Play (UPnP)</b> is a set of networking protocols that permits
     networked devices, such as personal computers, printers, Internet gateways, WiFi access points and mobile
     devices to seamlessly discover each other's presence on the network and establish functional network services
     for data sharing, communications, and entertainment. UPnP is intended primarily for residential networks without
     enterprise-class devices.</div>
   <div class='innerText'>aTalk uses all these options when setting up call between two end-points. These user
     defined options can be found in <b>Account settings... | ICE.</b></div>
       <ul>
       <li><b>Use ICE, Use UPnP &amp; Use jingle nodes</b>: It is good ideas to check all these options so as to
         facilitae higher possibliity of a succesful media connection. In the case for UPnP, the feature on the
         router to which the device is connected must be enabled for it to work. UPnP facitate a successful call when
         only one of the call parties is behind firewall.</li>

       <li><b>Auto discover STUN/TURN servers</b>: When this option is checked, aTalk will attempt to discover
         STUN/TURN using service domain from the user account i.e. via SRV records fetching. You should NOT enable
         this option if the account service domain is a virtual host, and cannot be resolved to a valid IP for actual
         network connection. An unreachable service domain will introudce an unneccessary delay of ~40Sec due to
         internet address validation during call setup. If user account service domain is a valid internet address,
         but does not support STUN/TURN, it is recommended that you disable this option. If you found that aTalk
         takes a long time to startup a call, you may try to disable this option to see if there is any improvement.</li>
       <li><b>Additonal STUN/TURN servers</b>: Allow user to define additional STUN/TURN servers for use as ICE Agent
         Candidate Harvesters. You may enter FQDN or the server IP address in the <b>IP Address</b> field. aTalk adds
         this list to the ICE Agent Candicate Harvester after the Auto discover STUN/TURN process has completed. If
         aTalk found zero user configured or from auto discovered stun server, it falls back to use aTalk pre-defined
         internal stun servers.
         <br/><b>Note: </b> The STUN/TURN server must not share the same public ip address as the device i.e. using
           the same network. Otherwise it is not possible for the device to discover its own public ip address,
           and the UPnP will not be working either.</li>

   <div class='innerText'>aTalk has an integrated photo editor that supports zoom, scale, rotate and crop functions. This
     simple tool helps publishing the user avatar an easy task. The following steps describe on how to add an user avatar:</div>
     <ul>
       <li>From main menu, select <b>Account settings...</b></li>
       <li>In <b>Account settings...</b>, click and hold the account to access the context menu. Select <b>Account Info</b></li>
       <li>Click on the account avatar near the top-left corner of the account info display page. Then select
         <b>Choose picture</b> to pick a picture from your storage.</li>
       <li> This will launch the photo editor and display your selected picture.</li>
       <li>Use the editor, select, zoom, rotate and crop the image area you want.</li>
       <li>Click the tick arrow on the top right corner to save.</li>
     </ul>
     
     <div class='innerText'>Please click <a href="./index.html">here</a> to
     return to main page, and playback the demo video for "User avatar" to get help on how to publish user avatar.
   </div>
   <div class='innerText'>In order to allow your buddy installed client that supports only either one of the avatar
      protocols, aTalk uses both methods to update the avatar on the server i.e.
     <ul>
       <li><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0084.html">XEP-0084: User Avatar</a></li>
       <li><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0153.html">XEP-0153: vCard-Based Avatar</a></li>
     </ul>
     This does take some times to store the avatar on the server. So be patient when you update your own user avatar.

   <span id='avatar_02'></span>
   <div class='blueText'>[20200214] Why some of the avatars for my contacts in main menu are blank? <a href=#content>{ Content }</a></div>
   <div class='innerText'>aTalk implementation supports both XEP's defined specifications in handling the contact avatars i.e:
     <ul>
       <li><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0084.html">XEP-0084: User Avatar</a></li>
       <li><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0153.html">XEP-0153: vCard-Based Avatar</a></li>
     </ul>
     Your contact device client must use either of these methods to publish or update his avatar on the server.</br>
     If you buddy client implements <b>XEP-0084: User Avatar</b> protocol, the server automatic sends an event on
     avatar hash for the buddy that is stored on the server after you have logged in. If the received avatar hash
     is different from the local stored avatar hash, aTalk then procceds to retrive the buddy avatar from the server.
     The avatar hash update event is sent whenever your buddy update his avatar with new image.</div>
   <div class='innerText'>
     If your buddy client supports only <b>XEP-0153: vCard-Based Avatar</b> protocol; the server only sends the avatar
     hash info embedded in the &lt;presence/> stanza when the buddy is online. If one or more of your buddies are
     offline when you first login, aTalk will display the avatars that were previously saved in the local store;
     or the default avatar i.e. blank figure if none is available.
   <div class='innerText'><b>Refresh Contact Avatar:</b> If you want to refresh the avatar of any contact; you may
     long click on the contact avatar shown in the contact list. aTalk will fetch and update the contact avatar immediately.
   </div>
   <div class='innerText'>Each avatar images stored on server can be few KBytes in size. During the process of
     avatars retrieving from server, sometimes network communications may get interrupted or aTalk encountered
     reply timeout from server. This can lead to incorrect avatars being associated with your buddies. You may use the
     above method to update the avatar of the contact. Alternative, please following the steps below to refresh your
     buddies' avatars.

   <div class='blueText'>[20190607] Why aTalk is not working properly on my old android devices? <a href=#content>{ Content }</a></div>
   <div class='innerText'>aTalk installation requires device with android OS 5.0 Lollipop and above for full features
      support. To have satisfactory performance for both video call and cryptography etc, aTalk also requires
      reasonable fast multi-core CPUs. A slow android device is likely to have problem in handling the vast amount of
      information from incoming &amp; outgoing streaming media data and cryptography processing. With aTalk installed
      on slow device, you may find response to user action is sluggish, and at time the screen turns black for a
      while before returning.
   </div>
   <div class='innerText'><div>Android N introduces Android Runtime (ART) with Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation and
      improved garbage collection (GC), replacing Dalvik that combines bytecode interpretation with trace-based
      Just-In-Time <a href="https://source.android.com/devices/tech/dalvik/jit-compiler">(JIT)</a> compilation.
      Android old devices with JIT implementation do experience problems during some timing critical tasks. It is
      observed that JIT compilation actually extends the time in processing task e.g. the time gets added to during
      stanza exchanges with server, hence throws response reply timeout exception at times. This usually happens on
      the initial launch after installation of aTalk. If you do experience this problem, relaunchs aTalk may
      resolve the issue.
   </div>   
   <div class='innerText'>The initial aTalk released in Google play store actually allow the app to be installed on
      API 4.1, with expected degradation in performance due to some missing libraries support on these devices. You are
      advised only to install and operate aTalk on a newer device if you cannot accept these performance degradation.
   </div>

   <span id='general_02'></span>
   <div class='blueText'>[20190716] aTalk - android OS API compatibility <a href=#content>{ Content }</a></div>
   <div class='innerText'>Android requires all new apk releases in 2019 with jni native libraries must support
     64-bit architecture. aTalk v1.8.0 released on 20190413 has included JNI native libararies supports for the
     following ABIS i.e. armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, x86, and x86_64. This release has also fixed the
     <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bionic/+/master/android-changes-for-ndk-developers.md#text-relocations-enforced-for-api-level-23">
     Text Relocations</a> problem reported earlier (Enforced for API level >= 23).
   </div>
   <div class='innerText'>aTalk uses many third parties libraries; some of these libraries have migrated and dropped
     support for lower android OS. In order for aTalk to continue using these libraries, it must tag along with these
     libraries migration paths. Starting with aTalk v2.2.3 release, the min android OS support has moved to android OS
     Lillipop or API-21. All aTalk releases have been tested to run on android-9.0 (Pie) or API-28.
   </div>

   <span id='general_03'></span>
   <div class='blueText'>Why do I see screen displaying "shutting down ..." message on re-launch after exit? <a href=#content>{ Content }</a></div>
   <div class='innerText'>When you exit from aTalk, the application must inform your registered server
      so that the client state is properly synchronized and also to give time to server to perform some
      house keeping tasks. When the server has completed the necessary tasks, it sends an acknowledgement i.e.
      &lt;/stream&gt; to inform the client, only then aTalk can proceed to close the connection and exit. If this required
      acknowledgment is not received due to network error etc, aTalk waits until a predefined reply time period
      has elapsed before exit. aTalk globally set the reply timeout to 10-seconds, this is to allow servers with
      high latency and for slow devices to operate properly.</div>

   <span id='general_04'></span>
   <div class='blueText'>[20200418] How can I give feedback to the developer for any aTalk problem encountered? <a href=#content>{ Content }</a></div>
   <div class='innerText'>aTalk has a built-in debug log utility that capture any runtime exceptions. In the event that
     you experienced problem with aTalk, you can forward this log information to help the developer to identity the
     cause of the problem, and to provide solutions in the next release if possible.</div>
   <div class='innerText'> Android clear all the previoulsy logged info once you have exited aTalk. If you have exited
     aTalk after encoutered the problem, you need to perform all the steps again that are causing the problem to
     allow aTalk to re-captured the info. Otherwise the log sent will not have the info of the problem. The log
     contains only minimum information to help identify the problem. No personnel sensitive inform are being included.</div>
   <div class='innerText'>To send the debug log, from main menu select "Help | Report Bugs", then pick your email
    client to send. To help developer to quickly identity the problem. a brief description and the steps to reproduce
    the problem happen is important. As the log contains only minimum info, and may not neccessary have the details
    that pin point the root cause. The description and the steps provided by you can help developer to recreate the
    problem and capture more log data in a developer software development environment.
