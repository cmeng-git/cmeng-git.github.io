   <div class='blueText'>[20190731] What information to enter in "Override server setting" when I setup a new account? <a href=#content>{ Content }</a></div>
   <div class='innerText'>In today advance technology, a physical xmpp machine can actually support multiple virtual
    hosts/services. The virtual host/service name is usually tag with the user xmpp account e.g. alice@example.org, 
    where <b>example.org</b> is usually referred to as service domain or virtual host.</div>
    <ul>
     <li> A Service record (SRV record) is a specification of data in the Domain Name System defining the location,
       i.e. the hostname and port number, of servers for specified services.</li>
   </ul>
   
   <image src="./img/atalk_account_setup.png" align="right" width="30%" style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px"/>
   <div class='innerText'>If you leave the <b>Override server setting</b> option unchecked, aTalk first checks to
     ensure the specified service domain is reachable; it searches for the actual internet ip address on a Domain Name
     Server (DNS). On success, aTalk proceeds to lookup the SRV record on the server which contains the required
     ip:port network information for connection.</div>
     <div class='innerText'>Initial connection attempt wil fail if neither of the following conditions is met, and
       you may need to enable the <b>Override server setting</b> option:</div>
    <ul>
     <li>The service domain host/server does not implement or contain the required SRV record</li>
     <li>The service domain name is a virtual host and is neither reachable nor listed in the DNS</li>
   </ul>
   <div class='innerText'>
     In the first case, aTalk uses the service domain resolved internet address and default port 5222 for connection.
     For server without SRV record implementation and connect via port other than 5222, you need to use
     <b>Override server setting</b> option. In <b>Connect Server IP</b> field, use service name of the xmpp account.
   </div>
   <div class='innerText'>
     In the second case, you need to specify the actual physical domain name i.e. Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)
     where the xmpp service resides. First check the <b>Override server setting</b> option, then enter the FQDN into
     the server setting <b>Connect Server IP</b> field. With this setup, aTalk will not look for SRV record on the
     service domain, instead it falls back to use the <b>Connect Server IP</b> resolved internet address for connection.
   </div>
   <div class='innerText'>
     <b>Note:</b> You may enter either a FQDN hostname or an IP address e.g. 115.66.84.204 in the <b>Connect Server IP</b>
     field. The user account name cannot contain IP address, use <b>Connect Server IP</b> instead to specify the IP
     address if the service domain name is not listed in DNS.

   <div class='blueText'>[20180818] SSL Certificate Authentication, DNSSEC and DANE Security Implementation for Connection Establishment
     <a href=#content>{ Content }</a></div>
   <div class='innerText'></div>
     <ul>
       <li><b>SSL Certificate Authentication</b>: The Secure Socket Layer (SSL), now technically known as Transport
         Layer Security (TLS) is a common building block for encrypted communications between clients and servers,
         basing on Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI) model. In a typical SSL/TLS usage scenario, a server is configured
         with a certificate containing a public key as well as a matching private key. During handshake between an SSL
         client and server, the server proves it has the private key by signing its certificate with public-key
         cryptography. However anyone can generate their own certificate and private key, hence this simple handshake
         doesn't prove anything about the server other than that the server knows the private key that matches the
         public key of the certificate. To address these downsides, the host platform generally contains a list of
         well known Certificate Authorities (CAs), and clients may only trust certificates that are signed by these CAs.
         However PKI is pruned to A Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack, and its implementation suffered also security
         breach by CAs. MitM is a cyber attack which takes place when a hacker (attacker) places himself between the
         client and the server and impersonates one of them. The DNSSEC and DANE attempt to alleviate these threats.</li>
       <li><b>DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions)</b>: The DNS is used to translate a FQDN domain names like example.org
         into numeric Internet addresses like 192.181.6.1, which can only be understood by router for a physical
         connection establishment. Unfortunately, the requestor/computer accepts any translated address given to it,
         without questions asked. This means existing DNS infrastructure is vulnerable to security issues; that allows
         an attacker to hijack this DNS process of looking a site up on the Internet using FQDN. The purpose of
         the attack is to take control of the session to, for example, send the user to the hijacker's own
         deceptive web site for account and password collection. Hence requirement to introduce a new DNSSEC
         technology to secure this part of the Internet's infrastructure.</li>
       <li><b>DANE (DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities)</b>: SSL/TLS encryption is currently based on
         certificates issued by certificate Authorities (CAs). Within the last few years, a number of CA providers
         suffered serious security breaches, allowing the issuance of certificates for well-known domains to those
         who don't own those domains. DANE enables the administrator of a domain name to certify the keys used in
         that domain's TLS clients or servers by storing them in the DNS TLSA Record. DANE needs the DNS records to
         be signed with DNSSEC for its security model to work, hence DANCE requries DNSSEC. Additionally DANE allows
         a domain owner to specify which CA is allowed to issue certificates for a particular resource, which solves
         the problem of any CA being able to issue certificates for any domain.</li>
      </ul>

   <div class='innerText'>aTalk supports the following connection establishment security mode. Please note
     that both DNSSEC and DANE implementations are still at expermental implementation by miniDNS/smack/aTalk. 
     DNSSEC does not work on server with a self-signed certificate or certificate signed by untrusted root CA's.
     You may refer to android Seurity Settings for a list of trusted CA certificates.</div>
     <ul>
       <li><b>SSL Certificate Authentication</b>: Perform only authentication of service's SSL certificate, verifying
         against the trusted root CAs who signed the certificate.</li>
       <li><b>DNSSEC</b>: Require all DNS information to be authenticated by DNSSEC; making connection only on success.</li>
       <li><b>DNSSEC and DANE</b>: Require all DNS information to be authenticated by DNSSEC, and require the XMPP
         service's SSL certificate to be verified using DANE.</li>

   <div class='blueText'>Do I have to enable IB Registration option when I setup a new account? <a href=#content>{ Content }</a></div>
   <div class='innerText'>"IB Registration" stands for "In-Band Registration" and is defined in
   <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0077.html">XEP-0077</a> standard. In general, if an account already has
   <div class='innerText'> <image src="./img/atalk_ibr_captcha.png" align="right" width="30%" style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px"/></div>
     been created and assigned to you by your server administrator, you do not need to enable IBR option during account
     setup. This is usually not true if you want to register an account on an online free xmpp server. Some server
     needs you to create an account via their web interface before you can setup the account on your xmpp client.
     If the server supports IBR, then you can create and register a new user account from within aTalk in one
     single step. When you setup an account with IBR enabled, aTalk does a pre-check whether the account exist on
     the server, and proceed with the IBR only if the login failed with exception &lt;not-authorized/&gt;.
   </div>
   <div class='innerText'>A few points to note when doing IBR registration as most server has the following rules set:
     <ul>
       <li>If you selected IBR but entered mis-spelled user name or password during login, aTalk will also prompt
          you with an IBR dialog even the account already exists on the server. For security reason, xmpp server
          always throws the same exception i.e &lt;not-authorized/&gt; for both "Invalid username or password"
          and "non-existence" account on server.</li>
       <li>Server will reject IBR registration for an account already exists on the server with:
          "XMPPError: conflict - cancel: User already exists" or similar. Click OK and aTalk will prompt you with
          the login screen. Check your password entry before trying to login.</li>
       <li> Many of the xmpp servers have a default connection timeout of 30 seconds, therefore you need to response
          to the captcha challenge within this time period. When timeout happens, just click OK to retry</li>
       <li>Password Strength: Minimum informational entropy for passwords. The value Entropy is a number of bits
          of entropy. The recommended minimum is 32 bits. Server will reject weak password entry. Just click
          OK to retry with new password entry.</li>
       <li>Registration Timeout: This limits the frequency of registration from a given IP or username.
          So, a user that tries to register a new account from the same IP address or JID during this timeout
          after his previous registration will receive an error resource-constraint with the explanation:
          “Users are not allowed to register accounts so quickly”. Default value is usually 600 seconds.
          You need to try it later after the registration timeout has expired.</li>
      </ul>

   <div class='blueText'>[20190620] Why my first login in sometimes fails when a new account is created? <a href=#content>{ Content }</a></div>
   <div class='innerText'>Most of the servers today have SSL certificates installed on their sites. The certificates
      usually are signed with the private key of a trusted certificate authority. The certificate contains the
      domain name and/or ip address of the server. When you visit the site, this certificate is fetched and
      compared against the public keys of all the major certificate authorities; and confirms with the certificate
      authority that the address listed in the certificate is the one to which it has an open connection.</div>

   <div class='innerText'>In aTalk, when you setup an account and sign in on new server, android OS checks for the site
     certificate validity during the SSL secure socket connection setup. If the site certificate is signed by a trusted
     certificate authority and is also listed in android certified trusted authority list; android proceeds normally
     with the SSL socket connection, otherwise it throws CertificateException.</div>

    <image src="./img/atalk_certificate_show.png" align="right" width="30%" style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px"/>
    <div class='innerText'>aTalk captures this CertificateException thrown by androis OS when the certificate is self-signed.
      aTalk then downloads the site certificate and check against its database. It prompts user for manual confirmation
      if the certificate is new to aTalk as shown on the right i.e. <b>Certificate Verfication.</b>. You can procced

      in aTalk database, and you will be prompted again in your next login.</div>

      <div class='innerText'>Alternatively, you can click the <b>Show Certification</b> button, the site certificate is
        shown with an user option <b>Always trust this certificate</b>. You must check this option if you do not want
        aTalk to prompt for manual confirmation on your next login. You can then proceed to login with the <b>Procced</b> button.

      <div class='innerText'>If you take some time to confirm the certificate before proceed, the server login hold
       time may have expired and the established connection gets disconnected. Under this case, you need to login a
       second time. If you continue to receive login failure, please check the error messages return from the server,
       make the necessary correction/action e.g. make sure jabber Jid, password entries are correct or IBR is required
       before attempt to sign in again. You may refer to other sections in this page on how to create a new account.</div>

   <image src="./img/atalk_contact_add.png" align="right" width="30%" style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px"/>     
   <div class='innerText'>In order to protect the privacy of XMPP users, presence information is disclosed only
       to other entities that a user has approved. When a user has agreed that another entity is allowed to view
       its presence, the entity is said to have a "subscription" to the user's presence. An entity that has a
       subscription to a user's presence or to which a user has a presence subscription is called a "contact".</div>
    <div class='innerText'>To add a new contact to your buddy list, from main menu select [Add contact]. A form is
      displayed for your input.</div>
     <ul>
       <li><b>Select Account Owner:</b> This spinner will list all your registered user accounts for selection. Select
         one of the registered users to assign the new contact to.</li>
       <li><b>Contact JID or Number:</b> Here you specify the contact Jabber (without the resource), whose presence
         status ou like to subscribe.</li>
       <li><b>Contact Assign Group:</b> You can group for new contact to your existing group or create new. Click on
         the selector for a list of options.</li>
       <li><b>Contact Display Name:</b> The new contact name you would like to show on your contact list. aTalk uses
         the Jid if you leave this field empty.</li>
       <image src="./img/atalk_contact_group_add.png" align="right" width="31%" style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px"/>
       <li><b>Add Button:</b> Click on Add button once you have entered all the new contacts properties.</li>
       <li><b>Cancel Button: </b> Click Cacel to abort the request and discard all the information entered.</li>
     </ul>
    <div class='innerText'>Click on the <b>Contact Assigned Group</b> selector will bring up the group assigning 
      options.</div>
     <ul>
       <li><b>No group:</b> Any unassigned contacts will be group under default <b>Contacts</b> group.</li>
       <li><b>atalk member:</b> Any existing groups will be listed here for selections.</li>
       <li><b>Create group: </b> The "Add Contact" dialog provides the option to categorize your new contact to
         one of your existing defined groups or a newly created group.</li>
     </ul>
    <div class='innerText'>If you select the <b>Create group...</b> option from the previous menu, a new dialog will
      appear as shown below. You may entered the new group name in the entry box provided. You may
      perform this grouping or moving to another group after the contact has been added. </div>
      <image src="./img/atalk_contact_group_create.png" align="right" width="30%" style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px"/>

   <div class='innerText'><br/><b>Adding Contact Process Flow:</b></div>
   <div class='innerText'>When you add a buddy to your contact list, aTalk actually makes an online subscription
     request to your buddy for his/her approval. In this process, your hosted server routes your subscription request
     on local machine if the buddy is of the same server; otherwise via remotel connection to the buddy hosted
     server. The server-to-server (s2s) connection setup uses the IP derived from your buddy account service name
     i.e. example.org from "buddy@example.org". If the derived domain is not a Fully Qualified Domain Name (DQDN)
     and canno be resolved to an IP, the subscription request process will fail.</div>
   <div class='innerText'>With the current XMPP standard defined for
     Presence Subscription, it is therefore not possible to add buddy whom resides on a different server
     where his/her account JID does not contain the FQDN. You are also unable to send message to your buddy in
     this case since the message is delivered via s2s network connection.</div>
   <image src="./img/atalk_contact_presence_approval.png" align="right" width="30%" style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px"/>
   <div class='innerText'>When you receive the Presence Subscription Request from your buddy via the hosted server, an 
     <b>Authorization Request</b> dialog is launched for your approval. You may Ignore, Deny or Authorize the request.
     If you accept your buddy request, reciprocally a Presence Subscription Request will be reverted by aTalk to your
     buddy for approval. Meantime your buddy will receive the acknowledgement of your acceptance.</div>
  <div class='innerText'>In the event if you choose to ignore your buddy request; any further re-authorization request
     from your buddy will not trigger another Authorization Request. However the server will resend the request 
     when you exit and login again. This process continues until you have made a decision either to Deny
     or Authorize the request.</div>
     <image src="./img/atalk_contact_presence_auto.png" align="right" width="30%" style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px"/>
   <div class='innerText'>Instead of manually approve upon each received Subcription Request, you may made this process
     automatically, by enable the option <b>Presence subscribe approval</b> auto accept all in the [menu | Settings...].
     In this case, aTalk automatically approves upon received a Presence Subscription Request from your
     buddy. It will also revert a request to your buddy for approval.</div>
   <image src="./img/atalk_contact_presence_accept.png" align="right" width="30%" style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px"/>
   <div class='innerText'><b>Note:</b> When you remove a buddy from your contact list, it automatically triggers the
     server to remove him/her from your Presence Subscription.</div>
   <div class='innerText'>Your XMPP service admin may choose to create share-rosters on the server, grouping all the
    related members in each categorid roster group. Upon first login, every member of the group will have his/her
    contactList populated with all the members within his/her roster group. This saves the memeber to manually subcribe
    to everyone in the related entity.</div>

   <div class='blueText'>[20181017] StreetViews &amp; Map <a href=#content>{ Content }</a></div>
   <div class='innerText'>Every location on earth has a global address, given as two numbers called coordinates.
    The two numbers ("Lat/Long") are a location's latitude number (north-south) and its longitude number (east-west).
    Together with help from google global location service, you can display the global address in graphical views as
    streetViews and map of the location understand by human.</div>
   <div class='innerText'>aTalk has implemented GPS location tracking, displaying both the streetViews and map on user
     device screen. The tool allows either a single location fix update or in continuous locations fix update mode.
     The continous mode update is triggered by two parameters changes i.e. <b>distance delta</b> or <b>elapsed time</b>.
     Either condition will trigger a new location fix fetch. The user selectable distance range varies from 0~500m
     with 5m steps; while the elapse time can range from 5~1000S in 10S interval. In continuous mode, user may choose
     only to send the location messages without displaying the realtime updates of streetViews and map information.
     This is done by not selecting the <b>Continuous StreetViews &amp; Map update</b> option to conserve data usage.</div>
   <div class='innerText'>On the streetViews and map display screen, you can select (press and hold) the little orange
     man figure and then drag to a new location on the display map, the streetView display will also be updated
     according to the new selected map location. You can also change the device pointing direction for a 360° panoramic
     view of the current select location on the map.</div>
   <div class='innerText'><b>Send GPS-Location message:</b> The tool allows user to relay his/her current GPS
     location in a single or continuous mode to his/her buddy as Geo-Location chat messages, i.e. only the longtitue
     and latitute information are being sent to conserve data usage. This feature is enabled from within the chat
     window menu <b>Send GPS-Location</b> option. When your buddy clicks the <b>SteetView &amp; Map</b> button on
     the received location message on his/her device, your current location is displayed on his/her device screen.
     The steetViews and map display on your buddy device automatically gets updated each time your new location
     is being streamed via continuous mode; tracking your move in realtime.</div>
   <image src="./img/08.gps_map.png" align="right" width="30%" style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px"/>
   <div class='innerText'><b>Note:</b> To protect your privacy, this feature can neither be accessed nor enabled
     remotely; neither it can be accessed from any other applications installed on your device.</div>
   <div class='innerText'><b>Show GPS Location:</b> You may use the tool as it without sending any of your current
     GPS location as message. This feature is accessed from the contact list main menu <b>StreetViews &amp; Map</b>.
   </div>
   <div class='innerText'><b>Locations playback animation:</b> If you have the location history messages in the
     chat window, long press <b>SteetView &amp; Map</b> button on any of location messages starts the location
     playback animation at interval of 2S. The playback anmiation either applies to incoming or outgoing messages
     grouping pending on which message you have initiated the playback animation mode.</div>
   <div class='innerText'><b>GPS Location Demo:</b> The feature has a built-in demo. Long press the
     <b>Cont. Location update (xm) @xSec</b> button starts the GeoLocation in demo mode. The streetViews and map
     will continuous get updated at 2S interval assuming user is moving in the north-west direction. If you enable
     this demo while in chat mode with another device as your buddy, you can see that the buddy device tracks
     and synchronizes the streetViews and map display following the user device.
   </div>
   <div class='innerText'>Followings are some possible use of the StreetViews & Map feature:</div>
     <ul>
       <li>Allow your love one at home to virtual travel with you while you are visting places on tour. Sharing nice
         scenary viedo wtihout consumming big data usage.</li>
       <li>When you are back from travelling, you can play back the location messages. A sweet memory recall or share
         with friends of all the places you have vistied.</li>
       <li>Lost your way while visting your friend? Just share your gps-location and start a voice call. Your friend
         can guide you until you have safely arrived at the destination.</li>
       <li>In the remote chance that you are in trouble; just start the continous location update to activate the 
         location streaming. Your love one can track your location and help will be on the way.</li>

   <div class='innerText'>With multi-user chat (MUC) or group chat, in which XMPP XEP-0045 chat rooms are designated;
     several users can share chat messages at the same time. aTalk implements most of the common features for
     MUC messaging. Followings are few of the terminology pertaining to MUC operations.
     <ul>
         <li><b>Invitation:</b> A special message sent from one user to another asking the recipient to join a MUC room.</li>
         <li><b>Member:</b> A user who is on the "whitelist" for a members-only room or who is registered with a MUC room.</li>
         <li><b>Members-Only Room:</b> A room that a user cannot enter without being on the member list.</li>
         <li><b>Occupant:</b> Any user who is in a room, uses &lt;room@service/nick> by which an occupant is identified

         <li><b>Persistent Room:</b> A room that is not destroyed if the last occupant exits.</li>
         <li><b>Participant: </b> An occupant who does not have admin status; in a moderated room, a participant is
           further defined as having voice, in contrast to a visitor.</li>
         <li><b>Room Owner:</b> The user who created the room or a user who has been designated by the room creator
           or owner as someone with owner status; an owner is allowed to change the room configuration and destroy
           the room, in addition to all admin status.</li>
      </ul>
   </div>
   <div class='innerText'> <image src="./img/atalk_muc_join.png" align="right" width="30%" style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px"/></div>
   <div class='innerText'>In the main menu, sliding right will show a list of the chatRoom's in which you have once
     being actively participated in the MUC chat. These are likely to be persistent rooms. aTalk has the following
     MUC features implemented.</div>
   <div class='innerText'><b>Join Chat Room:</b> Select this option from the main menu to create new or re-join an existing room.
     Pending on your room privilege, you may supply the NickName and ChatRoom subject when joining the MUC.</div>
   <div class='innerText'><b>Invite:</b> While in MUC session, you may select this option to invite new participants
     to join the MUC room. An invitation message will be sent to all the invitees you have selected. Your contacts
     may accept, reject or ignore the invitation. Except for ignore option selected, the accept or reject reply
     from your buddy is displayed in the chat window.</div>
   <div class='innerText'><b>Discussion History:</b> Depending on local service policy or room configuration, a room may
     send discussion history to the newly join occupant. Whether such history is sent, and how many messages
     comprise the history, are determined by the chat service implementation or specific deployment depending on
     local service policy or room configuration. Talk can receive and display all the history messages, while
     removing any duplicated messages.</div>
   <div class='innerText'><b>Chat room occupants:</b> Anytime during MUC session, you may select this opton to query
     a list of the Room Occupants currently have active participation in the MUC room. The list is displayed in the
     chat window.</div>
   <div class='innerText'><b>Converting a One-to-One Chat Into a Multi-User Conference:</b> Sometimes it is desirable to
     convert a one-to-one chat into a multi-user conference. In a one-to-one chat, just select <b>Invite</b> option
     to add existing buddy and other new buddies to the chat. A new MUC room will be created including all the new
     participants selected.</div> 
   <div class='innerText'>If you attempt to open a member-only room when you are not in the room member list, the
     process will failed with an error message. You will no be able to receive or send any messages in the chat
     room. Likewise you will receive an error message if you attempt to destroy chatRoom when you are not the

   <div class='innerText'> <image src="./img/atalk_muc_bookmark_row.png" align="right" width="30%" style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px"/></div>
   <div class='innerText'>For ease-of-use in a Jabber client, it is desirable to have a way to store shortcuts to
     various services and resources (such as conference rooms and web pages) as "bookmarks" that can be displayed
     or duplicate in other user's client. In aTalk implementation, the bookmark attribute autoJoin is also extended to
     be used as local standalone opton.</div>
   <div class='innerText'>When you slide to the chatRoom list upon first login, the chatRoom list will be populated, 
     in additional to your exisitng local chatRooms, with the chatRoom bookmarks you have previously saved (from another
     client) on server. aTalk auto joins chatRoom if the autoJoin option is being enabled in the newly downloaded
     bookmark or via locally specified autoJoin option.</div>
   <div class='innerText'>Each chatRoom item in the list is accompanied with two indicators/buttons. The two icons both
     served as an status indication and user input options. 
     <ul>
         <li><b><image src="./img/cb_autojoin_on.png" width="24" height="24" align="middle" style="margin:5px 5px"/>autoJoin:</b>
          Toggle the autoJoin option on/off. The autoJoin state will be saved to bookmark on server if the bookmark

   <div class='innerText'>When you click on the bookmark icon on the chatRoom list item, it brigns up the bookmark form
     as shown on the right for user update. Below provides a brief descriptions of each field in the form.
     <ul>
         <li><b>Account:</b> The user account to whom the chatRoom is associated with.</li>
         <li><b>Name:</b> A name of the bookmark for human readable information.</li>
         <li><b>Nick Name:</b> The user nick name used when joining the chatRoom. The Nick Name must not be set to null.</li>

         <li><b>Chat Room:</b> The chat room to which all the attributes in this form belog to.</li>
      </ul>
   </div>
   <div class='innerText'>From the main menu, you may also access to the chatRoom bookmarks. The new form is very
   <div class='innerText'> <image src="./img/atalk_muc_bookmarks.png" align="right" width="30%" style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px"/></div>
     similar to the one described earlier for the specific chatRoom; the differences are described below.</div>
     <ul>
       <li><b>Account:</b> The user account spinner contains all the users whom are registered on aTalk. When you 
        select a user from this spinner, the <b>Chat Room</b> spinner will automatically be populated with the list

       <li><b>Chat Room:</b> The spinner contains a list of the all the chatRooms that are associated with the
        selected user in Account field. The chat room spinner includes all the local persistent chatRooms that are
        listed in the chat room list slider page i.e. local and bookmarked. In additional it also includes all the
        chatRooms that are resided on the server, to which user has once joined as a participant on invitation but has
        left. If you enabled autoJoin and/or bookmark option(s) on any of these server chatRooms, aTalk will include
        this chatRoom in the chatRoom slider page when you click the <b>Apply</b> button.</li>
     </ul>
   </li>
   <div class='innerText'>If you have made any changes to any of the chatRooms in this form, you must click the <b>Apply</b>
     button to exit. If you exit with <b>Cancel</b> button, all changes made thus far will be discarded. However as
     a gentle reminder, if you click the <b>Cancel</b> button with any unsaved room attributes, aTalk will alert you,
     and request for re-confirmation before exit and discard all the changes.</div>

   <div class='blueText'>[20191004] XEP-0070: Verifying HTTP Requests via XMPP and WebView Implementation <a href=#content>{ Content }</a></div>
   <div class='innerText'> <image src="./img/atalk_http_auth_demo.png" align="right" width="30%" style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px"/></div>
   <div class='innerText'>HTTP (RFC 2616) is a nearly-ubiquitous mechanism for the publication and retrieval of information
     over the Internet. Sometimes it is appropriate for an HTTP Server to allow access to its site information only if
     the HTTP client first provides authentication credentials. While there exist several standardized HTTP authentication
     schemes (RFC 2617), it may be useful in some applications to enforce verification of an HTTP request by requiring
     an XMPP entity (normally an IM user) to confirm that it made the request.</div>
   <div class='innerText'><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0070.html"><b>XEP-0070</b></a> specification defines
     an XMPP protocol extension that enables verification of an HTTP request via XMPP. The XEP-0070 request verification
     can be combined with native HTTP authentication to provide a stronger association between the request and a particular
     user; as well as to take advantage of the strong user authentication provided in XMPP.</div>
   <div class='innerText'>aTalk since v1.8.8 has implemented the XEP-0070 protocol and intergrated a webView within the
    application. To have a better understanding the operation of XEP-0070, there actually exist an online demo site i.e.
    <a href="https://blog.agayon.be/xmpp_auth_django_demo.html">Demo Website: Authentication with XMPP</a> for this
    purpose.</div>
   <div class='innerText'>Folowing details the steps to show XEP-0070 demo on aTalk.
        <ul>
         <li>From the [main menu | Settings... | Web Access Page], enter the following site link <b>https://demo.agayon.be/</b></li>
         <li>Exit main menu, then slide left until you arrive at the webView page.</li>
         <li>aTalk will automatic load the defind webpage that you have entered earlier.</li>
         <li>Click the <b>login</b> link on the webpage, login page as shown on the right will be displayed.</li>
         <li>In the <b>Username</b> field, enter the xmpp user account that you are currently login.</li>
         <li>Then clik the <b>Sign In</b> button on the webPage.</li>
          <image src="./img/atalk_http_auth_request.png" align="right" width="30%" style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px"/>
         <li>Via s2s connection, the visting site sends the XMPP Server Requests Confirmation via XMPP protocol. Pending
           whether the entered user account ends with/without a reource; the site sends either an IQ stanza or a Message
           stanza request to the login entity.</li>
         <li><b>Http Authorization Reqest</b> as shown on the left is returned if you have entered the username ends with
           a resource. A similar one will be shown if the username is entered without a resource attribute, its dialog
           content is defined by the site admin. The demo site actually supports client that does not implement
           XEP-0070 to just reply chat message with the ID for authorization confirmation.</li>
      </ul>
   </div>
   <div class='innerText'><b>Note:</b> The XMPP HTTP Authorization request is sent via s2s connection, therefore you
     must ensure that the user account virtual host (i.e. domain part of the account) must be resolved to a valid IP. 
     Otherwise the HTTP will not be able to reach you.</div>
   <div class='innerText'><br/><b>aTalk integrated WebView Interface: </b>aTalk has also integrated a WebView interface
     within the application. When user slides left until this WebView is in view, it automatically loads the site
     address as defined in the main Settings....</div>
     <image src="./img/atalk_http_auth_signin.png" align="right" width="30%" style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px"/>
   <div class='innerText'> The purpose of the WebView is to allow an organation to display its official web page. The
     page can be used to provide the organisation latest news update and even for RSS feed. By default, if you leave
     the main Settings... <b>Web Access Page</b> blank, aTalk automatically loads the movim page. From here you can
     sign in to the site for their news update, RSS feed, chat etc.</div>
   <div class='innerText'>When a HTTP Server allows user access to the information only if the HTTP Client first
     provides an authentication credentials, aTalk will pop up <b>Sign In</b> form as shown on the right for uer to login.
     Like normal browser, you can navigate and click links that appear in the page. aTalk webView will refresh the
     page with the new page. For security reason, however aTalk will only load the page within aTalk application if the
     new link host address is the same as defined in the user setting; otherwise it will use android default browser
     for the web page display.</div>
   <div class='innerText'>You can go back to the previous page by using the <b>Back Press</b> button; or slide right

   <div class='innerText'>aTalk v1.5.2 has added support for Stickers, Bitmoji and Emoji rich content sharing using
     Google Gboard keybard. The Google Gboard keyboad is normally pre-installed on the latest android devices. If
     your android device does not have the Gboard, you may install it from Google play store.</div>
   <div class='innerText'>Android device with Google Gboard keyboard, it allows user to share sticker and Bitmoji in
    addition to the current emoji, in messaging apps like aTalk.</div>
    
   <div class='innerText'>With Gboard, users can download third-party sticker packs and/or the Bitmoji app from the
    Google Play store; and then send these stickers and Bitmoji while using the Gboard keyboard. When using the 
    Gboard keyboard, users first tap the emoji button, and then tap either the sticker button or the Bitmoji button
    to search for the content they would like to share with the buddy.</div>
   <div class='innerText'>Stickers, Bitmoji and Emoji rich content sharing is supported during an 1:1 chat or chatRoom session.</div>

   <div class='blueText'>[20190902] aTalk Fault-Tolerance File Sharing Implementation &amp; Enhancements <a href=#content>{ Content }</a></div>
   <div class='innerText'>aTalk file sharing implementation uses the following XEP protocols:
     <li><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0096.html">XEP-0096: SI File Transfer</a></li>
     <li><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0363.html">XEP-0363: HTTP File Upload</a></li>
     <li><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0264.html">XEP-0264: Jingle Content Thumbnails</a></li>
     <li><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/inbox/omemo-media-sharing.html">XEP-xxxx: OMEMO Media Sharing</a></li>
   </div>
   <div class='innerText'>aTalk supports send and receive files for all document types and images. There is an option
     to enable thumbnail preview before the actual file is being sent. To send or receipt of thumbnail, both the sender
     and recipient devices must have this option enabled; and the transfer file size is smaller than the 'Auto accept
     max file size'. The actual file is sent upon acceptance by your buddy. When XEP-0096 protocol is used, aTalk
     allows automatic acceptance of file transfer request or stickers sending if the size of the file to be transferred
     is less than the user defined max file size option.</div>
   <div class='innerText'><image src="./img/atalk_file_sharing.png" align="right" width="30%" style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px"/></div>
   <div class='innerText'>aTalk implements fault-tolerance file sharing to ensure reliability. aTalk SI File Transfer
     protocol supports both the SOCK5 and IBB bytesStream options, with IBB as fallback if SOCK5 failed. During file
     transfer, aTalk attempts to use the more efficient SOCK5 bytestreams method if the recipient client supports it.
     However if SOCK5 byestream method failed for reason e.g. client symmetric NAT fireware, aTalk automatically
     fallback to use IBB method to ensure a successful file transfer.</div>
   <div class='innerText'>In the event if your buddy client e.g conversations, does not support the legacy SI File
     Transfer protocol, aTalk will automatic proceed to use the <b>HTTP File Upload service</b> to share file with the buddy.</div>
   <div class='innerText'>When aTalk detects your buddy is offline, it automatically selects the HTTP File Upload facitiy,
     if the protocol is supported by your xmpp service, to continue with the file transfer.</div>
   <div class='innerText'>XEP-0096: SI File Transfer specification has no provision to transfer file when you are in
     a muc/conference chat room. Under this condition, aTalk checks the server for HTTP File Upload service support,
     and uses it if availabe to support file sharing between chat members in conference room.</div>
   <div class='innerText'><image src="./img/atalk_file_xfer_prompt.png" align="right" width="30%" style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px"/></div>
   <div class='innerText'>aTalk also supports 'OMEMO Media Sharing' procotol. During an OMEMO chat session either in
     1-1 or muc, all file sharing will be ecrypted before sending via <b>HTTP File Upload service</b>.</div>
   <div class='innerText'>aTalk harmonizes and uses a common UI in file sharing irrespective of which file sharing
     protocols is being used, and in all the various chat sessions. Unlike all other file transfer protocols, when file
     transfer is via <b>HTTP File Upload service</b>, the sender is unaware of the recipient status. After the sender
     has succesfully uploaded the file to the server, it forwards the file download link embedded as a chat message
     to the recipient. To allow recipient to retrieve the file, aTalk always shows the received file download link as
     a file transfer request. Selecting the <b>Reject</b> button does not actually delete the file link message. aTalk
     will show the prompt after user returns to the chat session later, even the user has previosuly selected the
     <b>Reject</b> button, either intentionally or unintentionally. To remove the prompt, user must manually select
     and delete the link message/prompt.</div>

   <div class='innerText'>In wireless communications, fading is variation of signal with time, geographical position,
     and radio frequency. Fading is frequent in mobile devices and may cause momentarily newtork data lost or
     disconnection. To improve network communication reliablity and minimize data lost, aTalk implements both
     XEP-0198: Stream Management and Reconnection Manager.</div>
   <div class='innerText'>In Stream Management, all stanza data exchanges between client and server are verified
     and acknowledged. When a stanza data is lost during fading, either entities will attempt to resend stanza data
     that has not been acknowledged by the recipient.
   </div>
   <div class='innerText'>In event that a sudden lost of network connection is detected, Reconnection Manager will
     automatically start the reconnection sequence using the algorithm defined below:</div>
     <ul>
         <li>at 5~15 seconds interval for 6 attempts</li>
         <li>at 30~90 seconds interval for next 6 attempts</li>
         <li>at 2.5~7.5 mins interval until connection is established successfully</li>
      </ul>
   <div class='innerText'>aTalk requires network connection in standby mode in order to receive messages or media
     calls. If you disable all network connection during device standy, reconnection manager will kick in once it detects
     network lost, and continues until you manually exit aTalk. Do ensure either GSM network or WiFi network remains
     accessible when device goes into standby mode. If all network is disabled in standy mode, you may also need to
     restart aTalk when device is waked up.</div>
     <div class='innerText'>Some of the availabe power saving mode that may affect aTalk operation during standby,
       options may vary depending on android device and OS version: 

      <ul>
         <li>Disabling Doze & App Standby for aTalk: Settings - Device maintenance - Battery - Unmonitored apps</li>

   <div class='blueText'>[20181015] Network Keep Alive - Ping Interval Optimization <a href=#content>{ Content }</a></div>
   <div class='innerText'>Most of the newtwork service provider inherently closes mobile devices TCP socket connection
     when it detects there is no data exchange activity for some elapse of time. The established internet TCP
     connection channel with the server may also be removed by the network after some idle time. If you find that your
     device is unable to receive messages in realtime or/and with aTalk goes offline frequently; you will need to go
     to [Account Settings... | Connection Settings] to select the <b>Enable Keep Alive option</b> and set the
     <b>Ping Interval</b> that is lower than the newtork data inactivity timer for your internet service provider.
     A good starting value is 240-second for the ping interval; and tweak the value if necessary with 20-second steps
     for the optimal device performance.
   </div>
   <div class='innerText'><image src="./img/atalk_ping_setting.png" align="right" width="30%" style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px"/></div>
   <div class='innerText'>aTalk has implemented an user option <b>Enable Ping Interval optimization</b> to
    allow aTalk to auto tune and optimize the Ping Interval time for network connection for each user account.
    This option is enabled by default until user disables it. The Ping Interval optimization is active only when
    your device is connected to the service provider via the mobile network connection. No optimization will be 
    performed when the device is connected via WiFi; During testing, no ping failure is detected when the device
    is connected via WiFi-LAN to the service provider.</div>
    <div class='innerText'>Following gives a brief description on the Ping Interval Optmization procedure with
      inital setting of 300s (or 5 minutes) </div>
      <ul>
        <li>aTalk ping the server at the regular interval as specified e.g. 300s</li>
        <li>When ping to server failed for 3 consequetive attempts @10s interval i.e. to take care network fading</li>
        <li>Lower and use new Ping Interval i.e. use step size of -30s if &gt;240s, else use step size of -10s </li>
        <li>Stop optimization if no further ping failure is detected or until min Ping Interval of 120s is reached</li>
      </ul>
    <div class='innerText'>Manual tuning is needed when &lt;120s is required. When optimization is completed or you
     want to set Ping Interval manually, you may disable <b>Enable Ping Interval optimization</b> option.</div>

   <div class='innerText'><b>Note:</b> When an established TCP data channel is terminated by network, neither android
     nor aTalk is able to detect this condition, until it failed while attempting to send data. Therefore Reconnection
     Manager is not being triggered when the TCP data channel is removed. It is therefore necessary to send the
     keep alive ping at regular interval to detect this condition for Reconnection Manager to work.</div>

   <image src="./img/atalk_permission_request.png" align="right" width="30%" style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px"/>
   <div class='innerText'>Starting with Android 6.0 Marshmallow (API 23), a new runtime permission model has been
     introduced; Users are not prompted for permissions at the time of installing the app, rather app needs to check
     for and request permissions at runtime. Users can then allow or deny the permissions for the app. Users can also
     grant or revoke permission anytime from within the android settings to override the permission granted during
     aTalk permission requests.</div>
   <div class='innerText'>Whenever user launches aTalk on Android-M or higher, it prompts the user to grant if there is
     any missing required permission. For aTalk maximum performance and full features support, aTalk requires the user
     to grant permissions for the following services.</div>
      <ul>
         <li>Camera - for video call or capture picture or record video for sharing</li>
         <li>Contacts - needed for phone state access and call setup e.g. telephony</li>
         <li>Location - GPS SteetView and Map display for a 360° panoramic view; Location sharing with buddy</li>
         <li>Audio - audio chat, voice and video calls</li>
         <li>Phone - phone features support - telephony gateway</li>
         <li>Storage - Access to android local storage for saving aTalk vital operational data and files. aTalk will
         fail unexpectly if this basic permission is denied.</li>
      </ul>

   <div class='innerText'>If any of the permissions is denied, aTalk may not work properly or may have unexpected
     behavior. If you have selected <b>Don't ask again</b> option, you will not be prompt on next aTalk launch;
     You need to go to android Settings -> APP INFO for aTalk to enable the permissions.</div>
   <div class='innerText'>Followings are also hold truth on aTalk reacts to the permissions grants.
      <ul>
         <li>aTalk will always prompt for permission grant if none are set to permanently denied on every aTalk
           new launch. This is to take care of users whom had unintentionally denied the permission on initial use;
           later want to use features that required new permissions. Normally user should not <b>Exit</b> aTalk as this
           ends and termates aTalk completely. Instead user should use <b>Back Button</b> to close aTalk window.</li>
         <image src="./img/atalk_permission_dontaskagain.png" align="right" width="30%" style="margin:5px 0px 0px 15px"/>
         <li>aTalk will repeatedly prompts user for actions if there are less than 3 permissions being granted even
           users had permanently denied them. Most aTalk features will not operate properly under these condition.
           If you understand and accept aTalk unexpected behavior, but do not wish to be bothered by aTalk
           repeated permission prompts; then always use <b>Back Button</b> to close aTalk window.</li>
         <li>It was found that some android devices have incorrectly implemented the <b>PERMANENTLY DENIED</b> options;
           hence aTalk will always prompt user for permission grants even the above conditions are being met. 
           It seems that the affected android devices have init all requested permissions to <b>PERMANENTLY DENIED</b>
           states, and OS returns incorrect results when aTalk performs the check.</li>
      </ul>
   </div>

   <div class='innerText'><b>Note</b>: If you change any of the resouce permissions via android <b>Settings</b>, you 
     must exit and restart aTalk for the granted permission to take effect. This is because some of the permission
     is only checked during aTalk start up e.g. Permission.CAMERA.</div>

   <div class='innerText'>The Voice over IP (VoIP) and other media applications uses Real-time Transfer Protocol (RTP).
     Many VoIP applications send RTP data over the public Internet in clear, thus the data is not protected from
     eavesdropping or modification. Therefore most VoIP applications are considered insecure today. aTalk supports SRTP
     and ZRTP etc to enhance the security for VoIP communications.</div>
       <ul>
         <li><b>SRTP</b>: Secure Real-time Transfer Protocol enhances security for RTP and provides integrity and
           privacy for RTP media connections. To use SRTP in an efficient way, VoIP applications should be

         <li><b>ZRTP</b>: Media Path Diffie-Hellman session key exchange Agreement for Unicast Secure RTP, is a
           protocol that negotiates the keys and other information required to setup a SRTP audio and video session,
           without additional infrastructure, server programs, registration, and alike. It indicates to the VoIP user
           if a session is secure or not, inform about problems and thier severity. ZRTP cannot automatically
           authenticate the end-users, this is task of the users once they can talk to each other.</li>

   <div class='blueText'>[20190607] Why aTalk is not working properly on my old android devices? <a href=#content>{ Content }</a></div>
   <div class='innerText'>aTalk installation requires android device with API 5.0 and above for full features
      support. To have satisfactory performance for both video call and cryptography etc, aTalk also requires
      reasonable fast multi-core CPUs. A slow android device is likely to have problem in handling the vast amount of
      information from incoming &amp; outgoing streaming media data and cryptography processing. With aTalk installed
      on slow device, you may find response to user action is sluggish, and at time the screen turns black for a
      while before returning. Please be patient to wait if you are in love and cannot part with your old android devices.

   <div class='innerText'><div>Android N introduces Android Runtime (ART) with Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation and
      improved garbage collection (GC), replacing Dalvik that combines bytecode interpretation with trace-based
      Just-In-Time <a href="https://source.android.com/devices/tech/dalvik/jit-compiler">(JIT)</a> compilation.
      Android old devices with JIT implementation do experience problems during some timing critical tasks. It is
      observed that JIT compilation actually extends the time in processing task e.g. the time gets added to during
      stanza exchanges with server, hence throws response reply timeout exception at times. This usually happens on
      the initial launch after installation of aTalk. If you do experience this problem, relaunchs aTalk may
      resolve the issue.
   </div>   
   <div class='innerText'>The initial aTalk released in Google play store actually allow the app to be installed on
      API 4.1, with expected degradation in performance due to some missing libraries support on these devices. You are
      advised only to install and operate aTalk on a newer device if you cannot accept these performance degradation.

   <div class='blueText'>[20190716] aTalk - android OS API compatibility <a href=#content>{ Content }</a></div>
   <div class='innerText'>Android requires all new apk releases in 2019 with jni native libraries must support
     64-bit architecture. aTalk v1.8.0 released on 20190413 has included JNI native libararies supports for the
     following ABIS i.e. armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, x86, and x86_64. This release has also fixed the
     <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bionic/+/master/android-changes-for-ndk-developers.md#text-relocations-enforced-for-api-level-23">
     Text Relocations</a> problem reported earlier (Enforced for API level >= 23).
   </div>
   <div class='innerText'>aTalk uses many third parties libraries; some of these libraries have migrated and dropped
     support for lower android OS. In order for aTalk to continue using these libraries, it must tag along with these
     libraries migration paths. Starting with aTalk v2.0.0 release, the min android OS support has moved to KitKat-v4.4
     or API-19. All aTalk releases have been tested to run on android-9.0 (Pie) or API-28.

   <div class='blueText'>Why do I see screen displaying "shutting down ..." message on re-launch after exit? <a href=#content>{ Content }</a></div>
   <div class='innerText'>When you exit from aTalk, the application must inform your registered server
      so that the client state is properly synchronized and also to give time to server to perform some
      house keeping tasks. When the server has completed the necessary tasks, it sends an acknowledgement i.e.
      &lt;/stream&gt; to inform the client, only then aTalk can proceed to close the connection and exit. If this required
      acknowledgment is not received due to network error etc, aTalk waits until a predefined reply time period
      has elapsed before exit. aTalk globally set the reply timeout to 10-seconds, this is to allow servers with
      high latency and for slow devices to operate properly.</div>

   <span id='general_04'></span>
   <div class='blueText'>How can I give feedback to the developer for any aTalk problem encountered? <a href=#content>{ Content }</a></div>
   <div class='innerText'>aTalk has a built-in debug log utility that capture any runtime exceptions. In the event
      if you experienced problem with aTalk, you can forward this log information to the developer to identity
      the cause of the problem and to provide solutions in the next release if possible. To send the debug log,
      from main menu select "Help | Report Bugs", then pick your email client to send. To help developer to
      quickly identity the problem. a brief description of how the problem happen certainly help. Send the mail
      after you are done.
   </div>
   <div class='innerText'>The log contains only the required information necessary to help identify the problem.
     No personnel sensitive inform are being included. The log will be deleted once the problem is identified and
     no copies of the log are being kept.
