   <div id='subSection'>Account Setup</div>

   <span id=''></span>
   <div class='blueText'>What are the email access methods supported by XryptoMail?</div>
   <div class='innerText'>Email account setup on XryptoMail may use either IMAP or POP pending your mail server
      configuration and support.
      <p><strong>IMAP - Internet Messaging Access Protocol</strong> allows you to access your email wherever you are,
      from any device. When you read an email message using IMAP, you do not actually downloading or storing it on
      your device; instead, you are reading it from the email service. As a result, you can check your email from
      different devices, and anywhere in the world. IMAP only downloads a message when you click on it, and
      attachments are not automatically downloaded. This allows you to check your messages a lot more quickly than POP.
      IMAP also allows you to synchronise mail folders between your device and mail client on the web, so that you
      see the same folders and messages wherever and however you access your email.</p>

      <p><strong>POP - Post Office Protocol</strong> is a very simple protocol that only allows downloading new
      messages from your Inbox to your local computer. Generally, once transferred, the email are deleted from the
      email server. This means that after the email is downloaded, it can only be accessed using the same computer.
      If you try to access your email from a different device, the messages that have been previously downloaded won't
      be available to you. Sent mail is stored locally on your device, not on the email server.</p>

   <div class='blueText'>What is OAuth2</div>
   <div class='innerText'>OAuth2 is an open standard authorization framework that enables applications to obtain
      limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service. It works by delegating
      user authentication to the service that hosts the user account, and authorizing third-party applications
      to access the user account informaton without giving them the passwords. OAuth 2 provides authorization
      flows for web and desktop applications, and mobile devices.
   </div>
   <div class='innerText'>Gmail uses OAuth2. If you disable 'Less secure apps' in Gmail Sign-in Security setting,
      You must then use OAuth2 method for your Gmail account setup in XryptoMail.</div>

   <!-- ========================= MAIL Cryptography ====================== -->
   <div id='subSection'>XryptoMail Cryptography</div>

   <span id=''></span>
   <div class='blueText'>Why is OpenPGP?</div>
   <div class='innerText'><a href="https://www.openpgp.org/about/standard/">OpenPGP</a> is a non-proprietary protocol
      for encrypting email communication using public key
      cryptography. It is based on the original PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) software. The OpenPGP protocol defines
      standard formats for encrypted messages, signatures, and certificates for exchanging public keys.
      As an <a href="https://www.openpgp.org/about/standard/">IETF Proposed Standard RFC 4880</a>, OpenPGP can be
      implemented and used by any individual without paying any licensing fees to anyone.</div>


   <span id=''></span>
   <div class='blueText'>What is Autocrypt?</div>
   <div class='innerText'>XryptoMail supports <a href="https://autocrypt.org/level1.html">Autocrypt Level 1 standard.</a>
      However only basic features for Autocrypt are implemented. Autocrypt aims to incrementally replace cleartext
      email with end-to-end encrypted email. An Autocrypt-specific mail header is sent with each outgoing mail, which
      contains among other information, the senderâ€™s public key. Transferring public key in-band means that key
      fetching in Autocrypt does not require external infrastructure like OpenPGP keyservers or x509 PKI.
      Autocrypt Level 1 specification focuses on the use of Autocrypt on a single device. Users get rudimentary
      support on using Autocrypt on more than one device or mail app. This is realized through sending and receiving
      an Autocrypt Setup Message, secured by manually entering a long string of numbers.

   <span id=''></span>
   <div class='blueText'>What is Stealth Message?</div>
   <div class='innerText'>Stealth message is an unique implementation for XryptoMail; whereby a received mail is
      auto deleted after it has been read. An acknowledge mail is returned to the sender after the message is deleted.
   </div>
   <div class='innerText'>When the recipient first opens a Stealth message, a 30-seconds timer starts to count down.
      The message is deleted when this 30-second timer has elapsed. However if the recipient exits the message view
      window before the timer timeout, XryptoMail will assume that the recipient has read the message and deleted
      it if there is <10 seconds in the countdown timer. Otherwise the recipient may re-open the message to read
      until 30-seconds timeout.
   </div>
   <div class='innerText'>Note: Do not include any attachement in Stealth message as it can be accessed with
      other mail client that supports openPGP.</div>
